## How to: (Як зробити:)
```Arduino
String text = "Hello, World!";
String searchText = "World";
String replaceText = "Ukraine";

text.replace(searchText, replaceText);
Serial.begin(9600);
Serial.println(text); // Prints "Hello, Ukraine!"
```

Sample Output:
```
Hello, Ukraine!
```

## Deep Dive (Занурення)
The `replace` method in Arduino was designed for simplicity. Historically, text manipulation has been part of programming since the early days. Alternatives include regular expressions in more advanced languages or manual character iteration in simpler systems. Implementation-wise, the `replace` method iterates through the given string, identifies the pattern, and replaces it. Efficient for small to medium texts, larger text handling might require optimized algorithms like KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt).
