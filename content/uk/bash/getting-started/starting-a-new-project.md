## How to: (Як це робити:)
```Bash
# Create a new directory for your project
mkdir my_new_project
cd my_new_project

# Initialize Git for version control
git init

# Create an initial README file
echo "# My New Project" > README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Initial commit with README"

# Output showing the creation of a directory, initialization of Git, and commit
mkdir: created directory 'my_new_project'
Initialized empty Git repository in /path/to/my_new_project/.git/
[master (root-commit) abc1234] Initial commit with README
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 README.md
```

## Deep Dive (Поглиблений Розвід:)
Starting a new project wasn't always as standardized as it is today. In the past, programmers might have just started coding without any version control or directory structure. Eventually, tools like Git became the norm for tracking changes and managing code.

A good alternative to manual setup can be using platforms like GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket that offer online repository creation and additional features like issue tracking or CI/CD pipelines. Each has a slightly different flavor, so pick what suits you.

Regarding implementation, good practice is to establish a file structure and a naming convention that stays consistent. Consider including a `.gitignore` file right from the start to keep unnecessary files out of your repository.
