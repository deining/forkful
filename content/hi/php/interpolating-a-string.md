## What & Why?:
Interpolating a string is a way to insert variables or expressions into a string. It allows programmers to dynamically manipulate strings and greatly improves the readability of code. We use this in PHP to make our code more efficient and to avoid writing too many concatenated strings.

## How to:
To interpolate a string in PHP, we use the `$` sign before the variable or expression we want to insert. For example, if we have a variable `$name` with the value "John", we can use it in a string like this:
```PHP
echo "Hello $name, how are you?";
```
The output will be:
```
Hello John, how are you?
```
We can also use expressions within the string, like this:
```PHP
echo "The result is: " . ($x + $y);
```
Assuming `$x = 5` and `$y = 3`, the output will be:
```
The result is: 8
```

## Deep Dive:
Interpolating a string in PHP is not a new concept, it has been around since the early days of the language. In fact, it used to be the only way to manipulate strings before the introduction of the `sprintf()` function. However, now there are other alternatives such as using concatenation with the `.` operator or using the `sprintf()` function.

When using interpolation, it is important to remember to use double quotes `"` instead of single quotes `'` as interpolation only works with double quotes. Also, keep in mind that interpolating large strings can be resource intensive and may affect the performance of your code.
