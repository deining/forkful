## What & Why?

At its core, removing quotes from a string in Google Apps Script is about cleaning or sanitizing your data. Programmers often do this to ensure the data they're working with is in the right format, or to prevent errors when parsing strings.

## How to:

Let's dive into the coding magic. Suppose you've got a string, and it's wrapped up in double quotes, single quotes, or maybe even both, and you want to get rid of them. Here's how you can tackle this issue:

```Google Apps Script
function removeQuotesExample() {
  var stringWithQuotes = '"This is a \'sample\' string."';
  Logger.log("Original String: " + stringWithQuotes);
  
  // Removing all types of quotes
  var stringWithoutQuotes = stringWithQuotes.replace(/['"]+/g, '');
  Logger.log("String without Quotes: " + stringWithoutQuotes);
  
  // If you're specifically targeting single or double quotes, you can do:
  var noSingleQuotes = stringWithQuotes.replace(/'+/g, '');
  var noDoubleQuotes = stringWithQuotes.replace(/"+/g, '');
  Logger.log("No Single Quotes: " + noSingleQuotes);
  Logger.log("No Double Quotes: " + noDoubleQuotes);
}
```
Sample Output:
```
Original String: "This is a 'sample' string."
String without Quotes: This is a sample string.
No Single Quotes: "This is a sample string."
No Double Quotes: 'This is a 'sample' string.'
```

## Deep Dive

Removing quotes from strings seems trivial but can be critical for data integrity and manipulation. Historically, string manipulation has always been a cornerstone of programming because data often doesn't come in a neat package. In Google Apps Script, which is essentially based on JavaScript, the `.replace()` method, armed with a regex pattern, is a powerful tool for such tasks. However, it's important to note that blindly removing quotes without understanding the context can lead to data misinterpretation or loss, especially in data formats like JSON. As of now, using `.replace()` with thoughtful regex patterns is your best bet in Google Apps Script for removing quotes from strings. Yet, always keep a lookout for new string processing functions or libraries that Google might introduce in the future.
