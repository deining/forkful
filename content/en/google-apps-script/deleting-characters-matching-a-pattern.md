## What & Why?
Deleting characters matching a pattern in Google Apps Script is all about finding specific sequences of characters in your text and getting rid of themâ€”think typos, redundant spaces, or even code snippets. Programmers do this to clean data, streamline inputs, or prepare strings for further processing.

## How to:
Google Apps Script, with its roots in JavaScript, has robust methods for string manipulation, making character deletion straightforward. Here's a practical how-to using regular expressions, which are perfect for pattern matching. 

Assume you've got a string littered with unnecessary hashtags and we want them gone. Here's how you'd do it:

```Javascript
function deleteMatchingCharacters() {
  let str = "Learning #Google #Apps Script is fun! #coding";
  let pattern = /#[a-zA-Z0-9]+/g; // This pattern matches anything that starts with a # followed by alphanumerics
  let cleanedStr = str.replace(pattern, ''); // Replaces matched patterns with an empty string, thus deleting them
  Logger.log(cleanedStr); // Outputs: "Learning  Script is fun! "
}
```

If executed, this script will log the cleaned-up string, removing all hashtags and the words directly attached to them.

## Deep Dive
Character deletion via pattern matching in Google Apps Script relies heavily on regular expressions, a powerful feature borrowed from JavaScript. Since its introduction, this method has provided a flexible way to identify and manipulate string parts based on patterns rather than just fixed characters.

While this approach is efficient and powerful, it's worth noting that entirely relying on regex for complex string operations can sometimes lead to complications, especially for those just starting with pattern matching. The syntax can be cryptic, and patterns can become unwieldy for intricate matching rules. 

For simpler tasks, direct character replacement methods like `replace()` might suffice, but the real power lies in mastering regular expressions for more complex scenarios. Over the years, alternative libraries and scripts have emerged to simplify string manipulation further, but the built-in methods in Google Apps Script remain the most accessible for straightforward tasks.
