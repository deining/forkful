## What & Why?

Handling errors in Google Apps Script is about writing robust code that anticipates possible hiccups and deals with them gracefully. Programmers do this to prevent their scripts from crashing unexpectedly and to provide helpful feedback to users, making their applications more reliable and user-friendly.

## How to:

Google Apps Script supports standard JavaScript error handling constructs like `try`, `catch`, and `finally`. An error-handling block allows your script to attempt an operation that might fail, catch the error if it does, and execute some cleanup or recovery code whether an error occurred or not.

Here's a basic example:

```javascript
function myFunction() {
  try {
    // Code that might lead to an error
    var sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().getSheetByName("NonExistentSheet");
    Logger.log(sheet.getName());  // This line will not be executed if the sheet does not exist
  } catch (e) {
    // Handles the error
    Logger.log("Error: " + e.toString());  // Log the error message
  } finally {
    // Code that should run regardless of the outcome
    Logger.log("Operation attempted");
  }
}
```

When `getSheetByName("NonExistentSheet")` doesn't find the sheet, it throws an exception that is caught by the `catch` block, preventing the script from crashing and allowing us to log a meaningful error message. The `finally` block executes afterward, indicating the operation was attempted regardless of success.

Another practical use is handling errors when interacting with external services, like fetching data from APIs:

```javascript
function fetchData() {
  var url = 'https://api.example.com/data';
  try {
    var response = UrlFetchApp.fetch(url); // Attempt to fetch data
    Logger.log(response.getContentText()); // Log the response content
  } catch (e) {
    Logger.log("Failed to fetch data: " + e.toString()); // Log fetch error
  }
}
```

## Deep Dive

Error handling in Google Apps Script, and JavaScript in general, has evolved significantly. Earlier programming styles heavily relied on checking return values and error flags, but modern practices advocate the use of exceptions and structured error handling for clearer, more maintainable code.

While `try-catch` blocks are powerful, overusing them can lead to "catch and ignore" patterns that suppress too many errors or obscure the root cause of issues. It's important to catch specific errors you can handle and let others bubble up to contexts where they can be dealt with appropriately.

For advanced scenarios, Google Apps Script allows the use of custom error objects by extending the Error constructor. This can be particularly useful for creating application-specific errors and managing complex error handling flows.

As an alternative or complement to traditional error handling, Google Apps Script developers might also consider using the `Logger` class for debugging and the `ExecutionLog` for tracking the execution of script functions. These tools can provide insights into where things might be going wrong, without necessarily having to manage complex error handling logic at every step of the script.

In contemporary JavaScript, "Promises" and "async/await" are increasingly common for managing asynchronous operations and their success/failure states in a more readable fashion. However, as of the current version of Google Apps Script, these techniques are not fully supported, making traditional error handling still very much relevant and necessary.
