## What & Why?
Handling CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files in Google Apps Script is about manipulating plain text files where data is divided by commas. Programmers do this to read, create, or modify CSV files directly from their Google Scripts, making it easier to interact with data imported from or exported to external systems.

## How to:
When playing with CSVs in Google Apps Script, you're usually going to work with Google Sheets (for reading/writing data) and possibly DriveApp (for file manipulation). Here’s a get-your-hands-dirty guide.

### Reading a CSV File
Assuming you have a CSV file in your Google Drive:

```Google Apps Script
// Define the ID of your file
var fileId = 'YOUR_FILE_ID_HERE';

// Get the file from Google Drive
var file = DriveApp.getFileById(fileId);

// Read the file's content
var content = file.getBlob().getDataAsString();

// Split the content into lines
var lines = content.split('\n');

// Log each line (you would usually process them)
for (var i = 0; i < lines.length; i++) {
  Logger.log(lines[i]);
}
```

### Creating a CSV File
Want to go the other way? Here’s how you can create a CSV file from an array of data:

```Google Apps Script
// Your data array
var data = [
  ['Year', 'Make', 'Model'],
  ['1997', 'Ford', 'E350'],
  ['2000', 'Mercury', 'Cougar']
];

// Convert array to CSV string
var csvContent = data.map(function(row) {
  return row.join(",");
}).join("\n");

// Create a new file in Google Drive
DriveApp.createFile('MyNewCSVFile.csv', csvContent, MimeType.PLAIN_TEXT);
```

### Appending Data to an Existing CSV File
Got an existing file you need to add data to? No sweat:

```Google Apps Script
// Data to add
var additionalData = ['2004', 'Nissan', 'Altima'];

// Fetch the existing CSV content
var fileId = 'YOUR_EXISTING_FILE_ID_HERE';
var file = DriveApp.getFileById(fileId);
var content = file.getBlob().getDataAsString();

// Append new data as a CSV row
content += "\n" + additionalData.join(",");

// Create a new file or overwrite the old one
DriveApp.createFile(file.getName(), content, MimeType.PLAIN_TEXT);
```

## Deep Dive
CSV handling within Google Apps Script has no unique, built-in mechanism—most of what you’re doing involves basic string manipulation or leveraging Google Sheets for heavier lifting. Because CSV is a simplistic format, this method is usually sufficient for many tasks. However, when dealing with more complex datasets (e.g., cells containing commas, newlines, or quotes), you might find yourself having to implement additional parsing logic or turning to third-party CSV parsing libraries that can be included in your Apps Script projects. 

In the historical context, CSV files have been a straightforward and universal way to exchange tabular data between different programs and systems since the early days of personal computing, due to their simplicity and human-readable format. While JSON and XML offer more structured data exchange capabilities, CSVs remain popular, especially in scenarios involving simple datasets or when interfacing with older systems. Google Apps Script’s interactions with CSV files leverage Google’s ecosystem, enabling web-based, serverless manipulation of these files, which can be exceptionally powerful when automated workflows in Google Drive or Google Sheets are required.
