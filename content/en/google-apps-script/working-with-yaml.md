## What & Why?

YAML, standing for “YAML Ain't Markup Language”, is a human-readable data serialization standard. Programmers use it for configuration files or in settings where data needs to be easily understood by humans and machines alike, such as in Google Apps Script projects to manage settings or configurations pretty smoothly.

## How to:

YAML isn't natively supported in Google Apps Script, so you'll first need a workaround to parse YAML content. Unfortunately, GAS doesn't have an in-built YAML parser. But fear not! You can use a JavaScript library, like js-yaml, or convert your YAML to JSON using online tools, then parse it with GAS. Here's a basic flow using a JSON conversion step as an example:

```Google Apps Script
// Assuming you have a YAML string converted to JSON

function parseYAML() {
  var yaml = `name: John Doe
age: 29
married: true`;
  
  // Convert your YAML string to JSON (this step would be manual or via an external tool)
  var yamlAsJson = {
    name: "John Doe",
    age: 29,
    married: true
  };
  
  // In Google Apps Script, parse the JSON
  var parsedData = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(yamlAsJson));
  
  // Work with your data
  Logger.log(parsedData.name); // Outputs: John Doe
}

```

In this example, the YAML content is manually converted into a JSON object for demonstration. In a real case, you'd automate this conversion by either using a server-side conversion tool or a JavaScript library that can be run in the context of a web app.

## Deep Dive

The relationship between YAML and Google Apps Script is more like a friendship of convenience rather than a deep, integrated partnership. YAML was designed as a straightforward, human-readable format that outweighs JSON in readability but falls short in direct support in certain environments, like Google Apps Script. 

Historically, YAML has roots in languages like XML and JSON, aiming to balance between them in terms of readability and simplicity. This makes it a popular choice for configuration files in software development, including for those working within the Google Cloud ecosystem, but with the caveat that direct manipulation requires some ingenuity, like using third-party libraries or conversion steps.

In Google Apps Script projects, JSON remains the king for direct data manipulation due to its native support and straightforward syntax. Yet, when readability by humans is paramount, especially for configuration files or when working with complex hierarchical data, YAML might still be your go-to, followed by a conversion step to JSON for processing. In essence, the extra step in converting YAML to JSON in GAS projects is a workaround, but one that leverages YAML's superior readability and JSON's universal support in JavaScript environments.
