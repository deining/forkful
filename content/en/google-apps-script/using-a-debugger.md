## What & Why?

Debugging in Google Apps Script is about squashing bugs - those sneaky little errors that creep into your code when you're not looking. Programmers debug to ensure their scripts run smoothly and as intended, saving hours of frustration and guesswork.

## How to:

Google Apps Script has an integrated debugger in its IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that lets you step through your code, inspect variables, and understand the flow of your script. Here's a quick start:

1. **Open your script**: Head to the Google Apps Script editor by creating or opening an existing script project.

2. **Set breakpoints**: Click on the line number where you want execution to pause. A red dot appears, indicating a breakpoint.

3. **Run the debugger**: Click on the debug icon (resembling a bug) in the toolbar. Select the function you want to debug from the dropdown list that appears and hit the play button.

```Javascript
function myFunction() {
  var a = 3;
  var b = 4;
  var c = sum(a, b);
  Logger.log(c);
}

function sum(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}
```

In the above example, if you set a breakpoint at `var c = sum(a, b);` and start the debugger, it'll pause right there. You can then inspect `a` and `b`'s values and step into the `sum` function to further investigate.

4. **Inspect variables**: In the debugger sidebar, youâ€™ll see variables and their current values. This is particularly handy to check if a variable holds the expected data.

5. **Control the execution**: Use the toolbar to step over (next line), step into (dive into functions), or step out (exit current function) of code blocks.

**Result**: By stepping through the code, you thoroughly understand how your script executes, line by line, and can identify where and why it's not behaving as expected.

## Deep Dive

The debugger in Google Apps Script hasn't always been as sleek or as integrated as it is now. Early versions required a bit more manual checking and less intuitive interaction with the IDE. Over the years, though, Google has refined the experience, offering a more seamless and powerful debugging tool tightly integrated into the development environment.

While the native debugger is quite powerful for most script troubleshooting, there are always limitations. For example, it does not support real-time editing and continuing execution, a feature found in some more advanced IDEs. For complex, large-scale applications, developers might lean towards logging or even external debugging tools that offer more nuanced control and insights.

Despite its limitations, for the majority of Google Apps Script projects, the built-in debugger strikes a good balance between simplicity and functionality. It allows developers, especially those new to programming, to get a handle on what's happening in their scripts without overwhelming them with too much complexity. It's a reminder that sometimes, the tools that feel almost too simple can be incredibly powerful in the right hands.
