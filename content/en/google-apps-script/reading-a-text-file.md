## What & Why?

So, you wanna read a text file in Google Apps Script, huh? Well, it's all about grabbing content from a file stored somewhere like in Google Drive and making use of it in your script. It’s super handy for tasks like config loading, reading data dumps, or just pulling in some text you need.

## How to:

Reading a text file in Google Apps Script is a walk in the park. First off, you need to get your hands on the file you’re eyeing. Let’s dive into some code to see how this plays out. 

```Google Apps Script
function readTextFile() {
  var fileId = 'your-file-id-here'; // Replace with your actual file ID
  var file = DriveApp.getFileById(fileId);
  var content = file.getBlob().getDataAsString();
  Logger.log(content);
}
```

In this snippet, you're doing a few things:
1. Grabbing a file by its ID using `DriveApp.getFileById()`.
2. Getting the file content as a string with `getBlob().getDataAsString()`.
3. Logging that precious content to check out what you’ve got via `Logger.log()`.

When you run this, assuming your file ID is legit and accessible, you'll see your file's content showing up in the logs like magic.

## Deep Dive

Reading text files in Google Apps Script hasn’t changed dramatically over the years, but the context in which we do it has. Initially, scripts were more about extending Google Sheets or Docs. Now, we're automating across Google Workspace, handling more complex workflows and data processing tasks.

That said, as simple and neat as this method is, we live in a big world filled with APIs and databases. While reading from a text file is great for straightforward tasks or small config loads, if you’re dealing with bulk data or require more dynamic interaction, you might want to look into Google’s BigQuery, Firebase, or even external databases connected through Apps Script’s JDBC service.

Moreover, consider security and efficiency. Reading large files or sensitive information demands careful handling. Ensure you've got permissions straight and maybe think about keeping those particularly hefty files or sensitive bits outside your main script’s flow to keep things snappy and safe.
