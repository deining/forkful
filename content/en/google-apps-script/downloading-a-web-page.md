## What & Why?

Downloading a web page in Google Apps Script is about fetching the HTML content of any web page via URL. Programmers do this to automate data collection, monitor changes on websites, or scrape data for various projects.

## How to:

Google Apps Script provides a simple way to download a web page using the `UrlFetchApp` service. This service sends an HTTP GET request to the web page's URL and retrieves its contents. Here's a quick example:

```Google Apps Script
function downloadWebPage() {
  var url = 'https://www.example.com'; // Replace with the web page you want to download
  var response = UrlFetchApp.fetch(url);
  var content = response.getContentText();
  Logger.log(content); // This will log the HTML content of the web page
}
```

If you run this script, it fetches the HTML content of `https://www.example.com` and logs it. You'll see the output in the Logger within the Google Apps Script environment, which will look somewhat like this (output will vary based on the web page content):

```Google Apps Script
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Example Domain</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>This domain is for use in illustrative examples in documents...</p>
</body>
</html>
```

Remember to check the website's `robots.txt` to ensure you're allowed to scrape it and always respect copyright laws.

## Deep Dive

Downloading web pages has been a cornerstone of web scraping and data mining long before Google Apps Script was around. Historically, tools like `wget` or `curl` were deployed for such tasks in Unix/Linux environments. While these tools are still widely used for their versatility and power, Google Apps Script offers a more integrated solution for those already working within the Google ecosystem (like those dealing with Google Sheets or Docs for data analysis).

Google Apps Script's `UrlFetchApp` uses Google's network infrastructure, which can handle robust web scraping needs. However, it's important to note its limitations, such as Google's quotas and limitations for URL Fetch calls. For heavy-duty scraping needs, standalone scripts with `curl` or dedicated web scraping frameworks in Python (like Scrapy) might be more efficient. Yet, for simple tasks, or integrating scraped data directly into Google Docs or Sheets, Google Apps Script remains an invaluable tool.
