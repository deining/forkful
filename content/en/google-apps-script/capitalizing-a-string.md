## What & Why?

Capitalizing a string means turning the first character of a sentence, or any significant text, into an uppercase letter while making sure the rest are lowercase. Programmers do it to ensure consistency in user inputs or display texts in a more readable, standardized format.

## How to:

Google Apps Script, being a cloud-based scripting language for automating tasks across Google products, gives us a straightforward way to play with strings, including capitalizing them. Here’s a cheeky little example on how you can capitalize a string:

```Google Apps Script
function capitalizeString(inputString) {
  if (!inputString || typeof inputString !== 'string') {
    return 'Not a valid string'; // Let's be safe here!
  }
  return inputString.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + inputString.slice(1).toLowerCase();
}

// Sample usage:
var myString = "hello world";
var capitalized = capitalizeString(myString);
Logger.log(capitalized); // Output: "Hello world"
```

The `capitalizeString` function first checks whether the input is valid. If it's all good, it makes the first character uppercase using `charAt(0).toUpperCase()` and the rest lowercase with `slice(1).toLowerCase()`, then concatenates them.

## Deep Dive

The concept of capitalizing strings isn't unique to Google Apps Script; it's a common functionality in many programming languages. Historically, ensuring the correct case of letters has been crucial for sorting algorithms, databases, and user interfaces where consistent data is key. 

In some other languages, there are built-in methods to capitalize the entire string or every word in a sentence (think Python’s `.title()`), but Google Apps Script requires a bit of manual tinkering—as shown above—to achieve the same. While this might seem like a limitation, it actually provides a great opportunity to get familiar with string manipulation and control structures in Google Apps Script.

Despite the raw approach, libraries or utilities specifically for Google Apps Script can offer more advanced string manipulation capabilities. However, for a quick fix or bespoke logic, the manual method reigns supreme. If you're ever needing to go beyond simple capitalization, exploring JavaScript string methods or regular expressions can provide robust solutions deployable in Google Apps Script as well.
