## What & Why?

Regular expressions, or regex for short, are sequences of characters forming a search pattern, mainly used for string searching and manipulation. Programmers use them to simplify complex string operations, from validation to parsing and transformation, thus making the code more efficient and less verbose.

## How to:

In Google Apps Script, you'll often use the JavaScript `RegExp` object and its methods. Let's dive into some common scenarios:

### Finding a Match

```Google Apps Script
function findMatches() {
  var myString = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog";
  var pattern = /quick/;
  var result = pattern.test(myString);
  
  Logger.log(result);  // Output: true
}
```

### Extracting Matches

```Google Apps Script
function extractMatches() {
  var myString = "I drive a BMW and a Tesla.";
  var pattern = /\b[a-zA-Z]+a\b/g; // Words ending with 'a'
  var matchedWords = myString.match(pattern);
  
  Logger.log(matchedWords);  // Output: ["Tesla"]
}
```

### Replacing Text

```Google Apps Script
function replaceText() {
  var myText = "Hello, world!";
  var newText = myText.replace(/world/, "Google Apps Script");
  
  Logger.log(newText);  // Output: "Hello, Google Apps Script!"
}
```

### Splitting Strings

```Google Apps Script
function splitString() {
  var myString = "One,Two,Three,Four";
  var splitArray = myString.split(/,/); // Split by comma
  
  Logger.log(splitArray);  // Output: [One, Two, Three, Four]
}
```

## Deep Dive

Regular expressions in Google Apps Script inherit their syntax and behavior from JavaScript, given GAS's foundation on JavaScript. They are a powerful tool for text processing, enabling complex patterns to be defined for search, replace, and split operations. 

Introduced in the 1950s in theoretical computer science, regular expressions have evolved significantly. Their inclusion in Unix tools in the 1970s and subsequent programming languages has cemented their importance. In Google Apps Script, they're as relevant as ever but come with a learning curve due to their terse syntax. While GAS provides functions like `indexOf()` for simple searches, the flexibility and power of regex make them superior for more complex text processing tasks. 

However, it's also important to be cautious; complex regular expressions can be hard to read and maintain, and can sometimes be replaced by built-in string methods for simpler needs. Additionally, when processing extremely large strings or in tight performance constraints, it's worth measuring if a direct approach may be more efficient.

Whether you're validating email formats, parsing log files, or cleaning up data, mastering regular expressions will unlock a vast array of capabilities in your Google Apps Script toolkit.
