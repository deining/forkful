## What & Why?

TOML, which stands for Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language, is all about making config files readable and easy to understand for both humans and machines. Programmers use it because it's simplicity and clarity can make managing application configurations less of a headache.

## How to:

Google Apps Script doesn't natively support parsing TOML files out of the box. However, you can use JavaScript's flexibility to work with TOML content. First, you'll need a reliable TOML parser. While Google Apps Script can't use npm packages directly, you can incorporate an existing parser library by copying its source code into your script project. For demonstration, let's use a simplified custom parser function aimed at decoding simple TOML strings.

1. First, create a new Google Apps Script project.
2. Copy the following basic TOML parser function into your script editor:

```javascript
function parseTOML(tomlStr) {
  var result = {};
  tomlStr.split('\n').forEach(function(line) {
    var keyValue = line.split('=');
    if (keyValue.length === 2) {
      result[keyValue[0].trim()] = keyValue[1].trim();
    }
  });
  return result;
}
```

3. Now, let's use this function to parse a simple TOML content. Add the following function into your script editor and run it:

```javascript
function testParseTOML() {
  var tomlContent = 
    "title = 'TOML Example'\n" +
    "owner = 'Sam Smith'\n";

  var parsedData = parseTOML(tomlContent);
  Logger.log(parsedData);
  // Expected output: {'title': "'TOML Example'", 'owner': "'Sam Smith'"}
}
```

This example is quite basic and might not cover more complex TOML structures, but it gives you a starting point.

## Deep Dive

TOML was created by Tom Preston-Werner, one of the co-founders of GitHub, as a reaction to the complexity of XML and YAML for configuration files. Its design philosophy emphasizes being simple to read and write, aiming to strike a balance between being human-friendly and machine-friendly. Despite its advantages, TOML might not be the best choice for every scenario. Its simplicity, while a strength, means it might not be as flexible or feature-rich as alternatives like JSON or YAML for applications that require more complex or nested data structures. For Google Apps Script projects specifically, you might find JSON a more straightforward option since JavaScript natively supports it, sparing you from having to embed or write a parser. Nonetheless, TOML's clarity and straightforward syntax make it a compelling choice for basic configuration needs, and learning how to work with it can come in handy for projects where TOML is the preferred format.
