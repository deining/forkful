## Why

Text files are a common format for storing and exchanging data. As a developer, knowing how to read a text file using Clojure can greatly expand your capabilities and allow you to work with a wider range of data sources.

## How To

```Clojure
;; First, we will need to import the "java.io" library
(import java.io.File)

;; Next, we can use the "clojure.java.io/reader" function to create a reader for our file
(def file-reader (clojure.java.io/reader "sample.txt"))

;; We can then use the "line-seq" function to read each line from the file
(def lines (line-seq file-reader))

;; We can then print out each line in the file
(doseq [line lines]
  (println line))

;; Output:
;; This is the first line.
;; This is the second line.
;; This is the third line.
;; And so on...

```

## Deep Dive

When reading a text file in Clojure, it is important to keep in mind that the contents will be read in as strings by default. If you need to convert the data into a different format, such as numbers or keywords, you will need to use the appropriate functions.

Clojure also offers various other functions for reading text files, such as "slurp" which reads the entire contents of a file into a single string, and "read-lines" which reads the file line by line and returns a lazy sequence.

Additionally, it is important to handle potential errors while reading a text file. We can use the "try" and "catch" keywords to catch any FileNotFound or IOExceptions and handle them accordingly.
