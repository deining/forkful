## Why

Text files are a common way to store and exchange data, making them an essential part of many software development projects. As a functional programming language, Clojure offers powerful tools for manipulating, parsing, and analyzing text files. In this blog post, we will explore how to read a text file using Clojure, and how this knowledge can be applied in practical scenarios.

## How To

Reading a text file in Clojure is a relatively simple process, thanks to the built-in functions and libraries available. Let's take a look at an example of reading a text file line by line, and printing out the content:

```
Clojure
(with-open [reader (clojure.java.io/reader "textfile.txt")]
  (doseq [line (line-seq reader)]
    (println line)))
```

In the above code, we first open the text file using the `clojure.java.io` library and its `reader` function. Then, we use `doseq` and `line-seq` to iterate through each line in the file and print it out. Running this code will produce the following output:

```
This is the first line of the file.
This is the second line of the file.
And this is the third, and also the last line.
```

## Deep Dive

Apart from the `clojure.java.io` library, there are other useful libraries for working with text files in Clojure. The `clojure.data.csv` library, for example, provides handy functions for parsing and creating CSV files. The `clojure.string` library offers functions for manipulating strings, which can be useful when working with text data. Additionally, Clojure's `with-open` function ensures that the file is closed and resources are released after the code is executed, avoiding any potential memory leaks.
