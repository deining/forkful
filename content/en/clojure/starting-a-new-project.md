## What & Why?
When a programmer begins a new project, it means they are creating a new program or application from scratch. This could involve writing code, designing user interfaces, and implementing various features. Programmers start new projects in order to solve a specific problem, build a new tool, or create something innovative.

## How to:
```Clojure
(def project-name "My New Project") ; Creating a new project with a name

(def project-info {:languages ["Clojure" "HTML" "CSS"] ; Defining the project's info
                   :libraries ["ring" "hiccup"]
                   :description "A web application for managing tasks."})

(defn add-task [task-name] ; Creating a function to add a new task to the project
  (let [tasks (:tasks project-info)] ; Retrieving current task list
    (assoc project-info :tasks (conj tasks task-name)))) ; Adding new task to list and updating project info

(defn display-tasks [] ; Creating a function to display all tasks in project
  (doseq [task (:tasks project-info)] ; Looping through task list
    (println task))) ; Printing each task

(add-task "Create user authentication") ; Calling function to add new task
(add-task "Implement task sorting")

(display-tasks)
; Output:
; Create user authentication
; Implement task sorting
```

## Deep Dive:
Starting a new project is an essential part of the software development process. It gives developers the opportunity to build something new and solve problems in innovative ways. While the above coding examples use Clojure, other programming languages such as Java, Python, and Ruby can also be used to start a new project. Alternatives to starting a project from scratch include using existing templates, frameworks, or libraries to streamline the development process. In Clojure, the ```lein new``` command can be used to generate a project template with predefined configurations. Once a project is created, developers can use various Clojure libraries like ring and hiccup for web development, or tools like Leiningen for dependency management.
