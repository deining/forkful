## What & Why?
Rounding a number is the process of adjusting it to its nearest whole value or a specified degree of precision. Programmers round numbers to simplify values, especially when dealing with floating-point representations that can be cumbersome and to prevent issues with floating-point arithmetic when approximations are acceptable.

## How to:
Clojure provides different ways to round numbers to make them more manageable. Here are a few examples:

```ProgLang.CLOJURE
;; Round to the nearest whole number
(Math/round 3.5) ; => 4

;; Round down (floor)
(Math/floor 3.7) ; => 3.0

;; Round up (ceiling)
(Math/ceil 3.2) ;=> 4.0

;; Format to a fixed number of decimal places
(-> 3.14159 (format "%.2f") (Double/parseDouble)) ;=> 3.14
```

Each function behaves a bit differently, so choose the one that fits your requirements.

## Deep Dive
Rounding numbers has been a concept as long as numbers have been used. In computer systems, the need to round comes from the way floating-point numbers are represented in binary, which can lead to numbers that aren't perfect representations of their intended value.

Historically, rounded values are also easier to read and understand, which is particularly useful in reporting and graphical representations of data. Before there were programming functions, rounding was done manually using mathematical rules. 

As for the implementation details in Clojure, the rounding functions actually come from the Java standard library, as Clojure runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This is why they might appear a bit different from purely Clojure-derived functions and operations.

Alternative methods can include manual rounding by using math operations or writing custom functions, but these can be error-prone and unnecessarily complex. Generally, it's best to stick with the provided rounding functions unless you have a very specialized requirement.

## See Also
You can look into more detailed explanations about floating-point arithmetic and rounding functions in the Java standard library documentation, as this will closely reflect how Clojure operates as well. Here are a few resources to check out:

- [Oracle's Java Math.round() documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html#round-float-)
- [A Clojure documentation on numbers](https://clojure.org/reference/numbers)
- [IEEE Standards Association's floating-point standard](https://standards.ieee.org/standard/754-2019.html), which underpins how floating-point numbers are handled in modern computing.
