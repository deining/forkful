## What & Why?
Checking if a directory exists is the process of verifying the existence of a folder on a file system. This is a common task for programmers, as it allows them to ensure that their code can access and manipulate the files within a given directory. It is an important step in file and directory management, as well as in ensuring the stability and functionality of code.

## How to:
To check if a directory exists in Clojure, we can use the `clojure.java.io/file` function and the `exists?` function.
```
Clojure (def dir (clojure.java.io/file "my-directory"))
(clojure.java.io/exists? dir)
```
This will return a boolean value of `true` if the directory exists, or `false` if it does not.

To handle any potential errors, we can also use the `try/catch` block.
```
Clojure (try
        (clojure.java.io/exists? dir)
        (catch Exception e
          (println "Directory does not exist.")))
```

## Deep Dive:
Historically, the ability to check if a directory exists was not always available in programming languages. This often required developers to manually search through file system directories and handle any errors that arose. However, as the need for this functionality became more apparent, many languages, including Clojure, have implemented built-in functions to handle it.

While the `exists?` function is the most common method for checking directory existence in Clojure, there are other alternatives such as using the `java.io.File` class directly or using the `clojure.java.io/file?` function. These methods may provide more specific error messages or different return values.

In terms of implementation, the `exists?` function uses the underlying file system API to determine if a directory exists. This allows for platform independence and efficient handling of errors.
