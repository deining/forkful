## What & Why?

Starting a new project in Arduino is essentially creating a new program or project using the Arduino programming language. This involves writing code in a specific format to control electronic components and create interactive devices. Programmers use it as a way to bring their ideas to life and create functional and fun projects.

## How to:

```
Arduino
```

In order to start a new project in Arduino, follow these simple steps:

1. Open the Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment). This is where you will write your code and upload it to the Arduino board.
2. Click on File > New to create a new sketch.
3. Give your project a name by clicking on File > Save As.
4. Write your code using the Arduino syntax and commands. For example, to turn on an LED light connected to pin 13, you would write ```digitalWrite(13, HIGH);```.
5. To upload your code to the Arduino board, click on Sketch > Upload.
6. If there are no errors in your code, the project will be successfully uploaded to the board and you will see your project come to life!

## Deep Dive:

Arduino was created in 2005 by a team in Italy as a way to provide an inexpensive and easy-to-use platform for creating interactive projects. It is a popular choice among hobbyists, students, and professionals due to its user-friendly interface and affordable price.

While there are other alternatives for programming microcontrollers such as Raspberry Pi and MicroPython, Arduino has a large and active community and a vast library of tutorials and resources. This makes it a great choice, especially for beginners.

Arduino projects can also be enhanced by using various shields, which are add-on boards that provide additional features and functionalities. These shields can be easily connected to the Arduino board, making it a versatile and customizable platform.
