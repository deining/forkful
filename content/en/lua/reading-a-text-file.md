## What & Why?

Reading a text file is the process of retrieving data from a file that contains written text. Programmers often use this function to access previously stored information, such as user inputs or configuration settings, in order to manipulate or analyze it in their program.

## How to:

Reading a text file in Lua is a straightforward process. The ```io.open()``` function is used to open a file and returns a file handle, which can then be used to read from the file. Here's an example of how to read a text file named "data.txt":

```
local file = io.open("data.txt", "r")  -- opens the file in read-only mode
local data = file:read("*all")  -- reads the entire file and stores it in a variable
file:close()  -- closes the file

print(data)  -- prints the data from the file
```

The output would be the contents of "data.txt", which could be a single line or multiple lines of text.

## Deep Dive:

Reading text files has been a common task in programming for decades. In the early days, files were read and written to using low-level functions specific to the operating system being used. As standardized programming languages, like Lua, were developed, easier ways to read files were introduced.

An alternative to the ```io.open()``` function is the ```io.lines()``` function, which reads a file and returns an iterator that can be used to loop through the file line by line. This is useful for large files that may not fit into memory all at once.

When reading a file, it is important to consider the file's encoding. Different operating systems and programs may use different encodings for their text files, which can affect how the data is read. The ```io.open()``` function allows for specifying the desired encoding to use when reading the file.
