## What & Why?
Generating random numbers is the process of generating a sequence of numbers that appear to have no pattern or order. Programmers use this technique to introduce unpredictability and variety into their programs, such as in games or simulations, to make them more interesting and realistic.

## How to:
To generate random numbers in Lua, we can use the `math.random()` function. This function takes two optional parameters, `min` and `max`, which determine the range of numbers to be generated. If `min` and `max` are both omitted, `math.random()` will return a random real number between 0 and 1. 

```
Lua
-- Generate a random number between 1 and 100
math.random(1, 100)
-- Output: 52 
```
The output will be different each time the code is executed, as a new sequence of random numbers is generated.

We can also use `math.randomseed()` to set a specific seed for the random number generator. This allows us to generate the same sequence of random numbers each time the code is executed, which can be useful for testing purposes.

```
Lua
-- Set a specific seed for the random number generator
math.randomseed(1234)
-- Generate a random number between 1 and 100
math.random(1, 100)
-- Output: 47
-- Generate another random number between 1 and 100
math.random(1, 100)
-- Output: 3 (will be the same as the previous output)
```

## Deep Dive:
The `math.random()` function in Lua uses the Mersenne Twister algorithm, which is a high-quality pseudorandom number generator. Pseudorandom numbers are not truly random, as they are generated by a deterministic algorithm, but they appear random to the user.

In earlier versions of Lua (before 5.1), the `math.random()` function used a linear congruential generator (LCG) algorithm, which is simpler and faster but not as reliable. 

An alternative to the `math.random()` function in Lua is the `math.randomseed()` function, which uses a more complex algorithm based on the time and current date. This can provide a more diverse and unpredictable sequence of numbers for certain use cases.
