## What & Why?
Creating a temporary file in Lua refers to the process of generating a file that is used for a short period of time and then deleted. Programmers often use temporary files to store data temporarily, perform operations on it, and then discard the file once it's no longer needed.

## How to:
To create a temporary file in Lua, you can use the built-in function ```io.tmpfile()```. This will create a file object that can be used for reading and writing temporary data.

```Lua
local temp_file = io.tmpfile()
```

To write data to the temporary file, you can use the ```write()``` method on the file object. Here's an example of writing a string to the temporary file and then reading it back:

```Lua
temp_file:write("This is a temporary file.")
temp_file:seek("set")
print(temp_file:read("*a"))
```

Output:
```
This is a temporary file.
```

Once you're finished using the temporary file, you can close it by using the ```close()``` method on the file object.

```Lua
temp_file:close()
```

## Deep Dive:
Creating temporary files has been a common practice in programming for many years. It allows for efficient handling of data that is only needed temporarily without cluttering up the system's permanent files. Alternatives to creating temporary files include using in-memory data structures or using operating system-specific commands.

Lua's ```io.tmpfile()``` function creates a temporary file in the system's default temp directory. However, you can also specify a specific directory by passing in a string as an argument to the function. The temporary file is automatically deleted when the file object is closed or when the program exits.
