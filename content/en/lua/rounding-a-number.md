## What & Why?

Rounding a number is the process of adjusting it to a nearby value to simplify it, usually for easier readability or to comply with significant figures' requirements. Programmers round numbers to ensure values meet certain criteria or standards, for reducing computational complexity, or to format output for user-friendly display.

## How to:

In Lua, rounding is not included as a standard function, so you'll often find yourself creating a custom function or using math.ceil, math.floor, and math.modf to achieve similar results. Here's how you do it:

```lua
-- Simple rounding function to the nearest integer
function round(num)
   if num >= 0 then
      return math.floor(num + 0.5)
   else
      return math.ceil(num - 0.5)
   end
end

print(round(2.6))  -- Output: 3
print(round(2.3))  -- Output: 2
print(round(-2.6)) -- Output: -3
```

To round to a certain number of decimal places, modify the function:

```lua
-- Rounding function to a specific number of decimal places
function round(num, numDecimalPlaces)
  local mult = 10^(numDecimalPlaces or 0)
  return math.floor(num * mult + 0.5) / mult
end

print(round(2.678, 1))  -- Output: 2.7
print(round(2.678, 2))  -- Output: 2.68
```

Remember, Lua's default behavior is toward zero rounding for negative numbers when you're directly using `math.floor()` and away from zero rounding using `math.ceil()`.

## Deep Dive

Lua, like many programming languages, operates on floating-point numbers, so rounding becomes necessary particularly when you're looking to control precision. Historically, Lua didn't focus much on mathematical operations, but as of Lua 5.3, bitwise operators and some integer support were introduced, reflecting a growing demand for such features. 

When rounding numbers, you're essentially choosing an appropriate approximation for a given context. It's interesting to note that Lua doesn't have a built-in function for rounding to the nearest integer, so you typically roll your own or pull one from a library. In contrast, other languages might provide specific functions for different rounding methods such as floor, ceiling, banker's rounding, etc.

It's also crucial to be aware of floating-point arithmetic's quirks. Since numbers cannot always be represented perfectly due to their binary nature, rounding can sometimes lead to unexpected results, particularly with a lot of calculations involving irrational or extremely large or small numbers.

For alternative approaches, one might look into the LuaRocks repository for modules that offer advanced mathematical processing, including various rounding techniques.
