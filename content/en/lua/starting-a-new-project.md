## What & Why?
Starting a new project means creating a new program or application from scratch. Programmers often start new projects to solve a specific problem or create something new that doesn't already exist. It's a way to put their coding skills to use and bring their ideas to life.

## How to:
To start a new project in Lua, you first need to make sure that Lua is installed on your system. Once that's done, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a new directory for your project and change to that directory in your terminal.
2. Within the directory, create a file with the extension `.lua`, for example, `main.lua`.
3. Open the file in a text editor and start writing your code. For example:

```
-- This is a comment in Lua
print("Hello World")
```

4. Save the file and return to your terminal.
5. Run the program by typing `Lua main.lua` in your terminal.
6. You should see the output `Hello World` printed in your terminal, indicating that your project has successfully started.

## Deep Dive:
Lua was first created in 1993 by Roberto Ierusalimschy, Luiz Henrique de Figueiredo, and Waldemar Celes at the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro. It was originally designed as a data description language for applications. However, due to its simplicity and flexibility, it has since gained popularity as a general-purpose scripting language.

Alternatives to starting a new project in Lua include using other programming languages such as Python, Java, or C++. However, Lua's lightweight nature and small core make it an attractive choice for smaller projects that require fast and efficient code execution.
