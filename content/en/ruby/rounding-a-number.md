## What & Why?

Rounding a number is about adjusting it to the nearest whole number or to a certain number of decimal places. Programmers round numbers to simplify values, improve readability, or prepare data for computations where exact precision is not necessary.

## How to:

Ruby provides several methods to round numbers. Here's how you go about using them with some examples:

```ruby
num = 3.14159

# Round to the nearest whole number
puts num.round    # Output: 3

# Round to 2 decimal places
puts num.round(2) # Output: 3.14

# Round down with floor
puts num.floor    # Output: 3

# Round up with ceil
puts num.ceil     # Output: 4
```

Remember that the `.round` method can take an argument specifying the number of decimal places to which the number should be rounded. The `.floor` and `.ceil` methods round the number down and up to the nearest whole number, respectively.

## Deep Dive

Rounding numbers is a common need in programming dating back to its early days because it helps manage precision and performance. Historicaly, as floating-point arithmetic introduced complexity and precision issues, rounding became an essential tool to prevent errors in calculations and comparisons.

Ruby's `round` method is a flexible tool, using "round half up" as its default strategy, that is, it rounds towards the nearest neighbor, unless both neighbors are equidistant, in which case it rounds up. Alternative methods like `floor` and `ceil` are more straightforward; `floor` always rounds down, and `ceil` always rounds up, regardless of the distance to the nearest full integer.

Implementation details are critical when dealing with large datasets, financial calculations, or where the precision impacts the outcome significantly. It's important to note that rounding can introduce a rounding error, though typically negligible, into calculations that when compounded can have more substantial effects.
