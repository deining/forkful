## Why
As developers, we want our code to be reliable and error-free. Writing tests is essential in ensuring that our code works as intended and to catch any potential bugs before they make their way into production. By writing tests, we can increase the overall quality of our code and have confidence in its functionality.

## How To
To write tests in Ruby, we will be using a popular testing framework called RSpec. Let's take a look at how we can create a simple test for a method that adds two numbers together.

```
Ruby require 'rspec'

# Define our method for addition
def add(num1, num2)
  num1 + num2
end

# Call RSpec's describe method and pass in the method we want to test
describe '#add' do
  it 'adds two numbers together' do
    # Call RSpec's expect method to compare the output of our method
    expect(add(2, 3)).to eq(5)
  end
end
```

To run this test, we can save it into a file called `add_spec.rb` and then use the `rspec` command in our terminal. This will give us a clear indication as to whether our test has passed or failed. In this case, our test will succeed, since the expected output of `5` is equal to the actual output of our `add` method.

## Deep Dive
When writing tests, there are a few important concepts to keep in mind. Firstly, your tests should be specific and cover different scenarios of your code. It's also important to have a balance between testing too much and testing too little. Finding the right balance can take some practice, but ultimately your goal is to have thorough tests without being overly redundant.

You can also use Ruby's `context` and `before` blocks within your tests to organize and set up any variables or methods that may be needed for multiple tests.

Lastly, it's important to have a good understanding of RSpec's syntax, including the various matchers such as `eq` and `be_truthy` that can be used to compare values or check for truthiness.
