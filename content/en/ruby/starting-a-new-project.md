## What & Why?
Starting a new project in programming means creating a new software or application from scratch. Programmers do this to solve a problem, create something new, or improve existing technology.

## How to:
To start a new project in Ruby, you first need to have Ruby installed on your computer. Then, you can create a new project folder in your desired location. Next, open your terminal and navigate to the project folder. Finally, use the ```ruby``` command followed by the name of the Ruby file you want to create. For example, ```ruby hello.rb``` will create a new Ruby file named "hello" in your project folder.

## Deep Dive:
Starting a new project in Ruby has become easier with the development of tools such as Bundler, which helps manage dependencies, and RubyGems, which allows for easy installation of libraries. Before these tools, programmers had to manually keep track of dependencies and install libraries, making the process more time-consuming. Additionally, there are alternative languages and frameworks, such as Python and JavaScript, that can also be used for starting new projects.
