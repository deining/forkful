## Why

Are you looking to start a new programming project? Well, look no further than Ruby! This dynamic and object-oriented language has become increasingly popular in recent years and is ideal for building web applications, scripting, and much more. Trust us, once you start coding in Ruby, you won't want to stop.

## How To

To start a new project in Ruby, all you need is a computer and a text editor. Let's walk through a simple example of creating a "Hello World" program.

First, open your favorite text editor and create a new file with a .rb extension. This will tell your computer that it's a Ruby file. We'll name our file "hello_world.rb".

Next, we'll write some code using the `puts` method. This method is used to output a string to the console. In this case, we want to print the phrase "Hello World!" so we'll type:

```Ruby
puts "Hello World!"
```

Save the file and navigate to the directory where it is saved using your computer's command line. Then, run the following command to execute your program:

```Ruby
ruby hello_world.rb
```

You should see the output "Hello World!" printed to the console. Congratulations, you just created your first Ruby program!

## Deep Dive

Starting a new project in Ruby is not only easy, but it also offers a wide range of flexibility. Ruby's syntax is simple and allows for quick development, making it an ideal choice for building prototypes and MVPs (Minimum Viable Products). It also has a vast library of third-party tools and gems, making it easy to add additional features and functionality to your project.

Additionally, Ruby has a strong and supportive community, with many resources available for learning and troubleshooting. So if you ever find yourself stuck on a problem, don't worry - there are plenty of resources and people willing to help you out.
