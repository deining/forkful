## Why

Are you thinking of starting a new project with Ruby? Well, there are plenty of reasons why you might want to! Perhaps you're looking to expand your coding skills, create a useful tool, or just have some fun. No matter what your motivation may be, starting a new project in Ruby can be a rewarding experience.

## How To

To start a new project in Ruby, you'll need to have Ruby installed on your computer. Once that's taken care of, follow these steps:

2. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory you just created.
3. In your terminal, type `touch main.rb` to create a new Ruby file.
4. Open the file in your preferred code editor.
5. Start coding! Here's a simple hello world example to get you started:

```Ruby
# This is a basic hello world program in Ruby!
puts "Hello World!"
```

6. Save your file and run it in your terminal by typing `ruby main.rb`.
7. You should see the output `Hello World!` in your terminal.

And that's it! You've successfully started a new project in Ruby.
