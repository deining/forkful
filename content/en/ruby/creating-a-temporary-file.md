## Why

Creating temporary files in Ruby can serve a variety of purposes, such as storing temporary data or creating placeholders for future files. By learning how to create temporary files in Ruby, you can add more functionality to your code and make your programs more dynamic and versatile.

## How To

To create a temporary file in Ruby, we can use the built-in ``Tempfile`` class. This class provides methods for creating, writing, reading, and deleting temporary files.

```Ruby
# First, we need to require the Tempfile library
require 'tempfile'

# Then, we can create a new temporary file using the "new" method
# We can also specify a prefix and suffix for the file name
# In this example, the file name will be "temp_file123.tmp"
temp_file = Tempfile.new("temp_file123")

# We can write to the file using the "write" method
temp_file.write("This is some sample text.")

# To read from the file, we can use the "read" method
puts temp_file.read
# Output: This is some sample text.

# After we are done using the file, we should close it
temp_file.close

# We can also use the "open" method to create and automatically close the file
# We can also specify the file mode (write, read, etc.)
# In this example, we create a temporary file in "w+" (write) mode
# The file name will be "temp_file456.tmp"
Tempfile.open('temp_file456', 'w+') do |temp_file|
    temp_file.write("Another example of writing to a temporary file.")
end

# When the block ends, the file will automatically be closed and deleted

# We can also specify the directory for the temporary file
# If not specified, it will default to the directory of the Ruby script
Tempfile.new("temp_file789", "./my_folder/")

# To delete a temporary file manually, we can use the "unlink" method
# This will delete the file and return the file name
puts temp_file.unlink
# Output: temp_file123.tmp
```

## Deep Dive

The ``Tempfile`` class also has various options and methods that can be used to customize our temporary files. For example, we can set the encoding for the file using the ``encoding`` option, or specify a directory and prefix for the file name using the ``dir`` and ``prefix`` options.

There are also different file modes that we can use when creating a temporary file, such as "r+" for read and write, "a+" for append and read, and "u+" for read and write with sync mode.

It is important to remember to close and delete temporary files after we are done using them, as they can clutter up the system and cause memory issues if left open. We can also specify a different location for temporary files by setting the ``TMPDIR`` environment variable, which can be useful for testing or debugging purposes.
