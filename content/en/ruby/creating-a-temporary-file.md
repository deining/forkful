## What & Why?

Creating temporary files is a common practice in programming, where developers need to temporarily store data or information during the execution of a program. Temporary files are created and used only for a specific purpose and are discarded once the program has finished running. This helps in avoiding clutter and maintaining the overall efficiency of the program. 

## How to:

To create a temporary file in Ruby, we can use the `Tempfile` class. An instance of this class can be created by passing in a prefix for the file name. Once the data has been written to the file, we can open it using the `open` method and perform operations on it. Here's an example: 

```Ruby
require 'tempfile' 
file = Tempfile.new("data") 
file.write("This is a temporary file.") 
file.open 
puts file.read 
# Output: This is a temporary file.
```

After the program has finished executing, the temporary file is automatically deleted. We can also specify a specific directory for the temporary file by passing in a directory path as a second argument to the `Tempfile.new` method. 

## Deep Dive

The concept of creating temporary files has been around for a long time and is commonly used in operating systems as well. However, with the advancement of programming languages and technologies, developers now have the option to use alternative methods for temporary data storage, such as in-memory databases. 

In Ruby, another way to create temporary files is by using the `File` class and the `Dir` class. However, using the `Tempfile` class is considered a better option as it ensures proper handling and deletion of the file. The `Tempfile` class also provides additional methods for file operations.

While creating temporary files, it is important to consider security measures to prevent any unauthorized access or manipulation of the data. In Ruby, we can set permissions for the temporary file using the `chmod` method from the `File` class.
