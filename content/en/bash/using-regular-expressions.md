## What & Why?
Using regular expressions in Bash allows programmers to efficiently search and manipulate text data. Regular expressions are a set of characters that define a search pattern, allowing complex matching and replacement of text. Programmers use regular expressions to automate tasks that involve text manipulation and data validation.

## How to:
To use regular expressions in Bash, we can use the "grep" command with the "-E" option for extended regular expressions. For example, to search for the word "hello" in a file called "text.txt", we would use the following command:
```Bash
grep -E "hello" text.txt
```
This will output any lines in the "text.txt" file that contain the word "hello".

We can also use regular expressions for data manipulation. For example, if we wanted to replace all occurrences of the word "cat" with "dog" in a file called "animals.txt", we can use the "sed" command with the "s" option:
```Bash
sed -i "s/cat/dog/g" animals.txt
```
This will replace all instances of "cat" with "dog" in the "animals.txt" file.

Regular expressions can also be used for data validation. We can use the "=~" operator in Bash to check if a string matches a regular expression. For example:
```Bash
if [[ "1234" =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]]; then
  echo "Valid number"
else
  echo "Invalid number"
fi
```
This will output "Valid number" as the string "1234" consists of only numbers.

## Deep Dive:
Regular expressions have been around since the 1950s and were originally used in the programming language SNOBOL. They have since been adopted by many other programming languages, including Bash.

There are also other ways to use regular expressions in Bash. The "awk" command also supports regular expressions and can be used for more complex data manipulation. Additionally, there are various third-party libraries and tools that can be used for regular expressions in Bash.

Regular expressions in Bash are implemented using the "regex" library and its corresponding functions. This library follows the POSIX regular expression standard, which means that regular expressions used in Bash will also work in other POSIX-compliant programming languages.
