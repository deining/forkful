## What & Why?

Working with CSV (Comma Separated Values) is a common task for programmers. As the name suggests, it involves dealing with data that is separated by commas, usually in a tabular format. CSV files are commonly used to store and transfer data, making them a popular choice for handling large datasets in a structured manner. With the rise of Big Data and the need for efficient data management, the use of CSV files has become even more prevalent in the programming world.

## How to:

To work with CSV files in Bash, you can use the built-in `csv` tool. This tool provides a set of functions for handling CSV data, such as converting CSV to arrays, extracting specific columns, and sorting data. Here's an example of how to extract the first column from a CSV file:

```Bash
csvtool col 1 example.csv 
```

The output would be the first column of data from the file `example.csv`. You can also use the `csvtool sort` command to sort data based on a specific column. Here's an example of how to sort a CSV file based on the second column:

```Bash
csvtool sort 2 example.csv 
```

## Deep Dive

CSV files have been around since the early 1970s and have been a popular choice for storing and transferring data due to their simplicity and compatibility with a wide range of programs. However, CSV files do have some limitations, such as not being able to handle complex data structures. As a result, alternative formats such as JSON and XML have gained popularity in recent years.

Working with CSV files in Bash requires the installation of the `csvtool` package. This package is part of the `debianutils` package and is usually pre-installed in most Linux distributions. `csvtool` is a set of command-line tools that use Unix's philosophy of small, simple, and composable tools to handle CSV data efficiently.
