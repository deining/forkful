## What & Why?
Starting a new project is the process of creating a new software, application, or program from scratch. Programmers do this to solve a specific problem or fulfill a need, either for themselves or for others.

## How to:
To start a new project in Bash, you can follow these steps:
```Bash
# Create a new directory for your project 
mkdir my_project
# Move into the directory you just created 
cd my_project 
# Initialize the project using Git 
git init 
# Create a new file for your project 
touch app.sh
```
You now have a new directory for your project and a blank file to start coding in.

## Deep Dive:
Starting a new project is an essential part of the software development process. It allows programmers to have a clean and organized starting point for their code, making it easier to maintain and add new features as the project evolves.

Before the introduction of Git, programmers typically used version control systems like Subversion or CVS to manage their projects. However, Git offers a more flexible and decentralized approach, making it the preferred choice for many developers.

Alternatives to starting a new project in Bash include using a development environment or IDE like Visual Studio Code, which provides built-in project management tools.

There are no specific implementation details for starting a new project in Bash, as it is a simple and straightforward process. However, it is essential to set up proper project organization and version control practices to ensure a smooth development journey.
