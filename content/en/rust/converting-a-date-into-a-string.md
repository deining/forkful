## What & Why?

Converting a date into a string is the process of converting a date data type into a string data type that can be easily read and manipulated by a computer. This is a common task for programmers, as it allows them to display and work with dates in a more user-friendly format.

## How to:

Here's a simple example of how to convert a date into a string in Rust:

```Rust
use std::time::{SystemTime, UNIX_EPOCH};

// Get the current time
let now = SystemTime::now();

// Convert it to a UNIX timestamp
let seconds = now.duration_since(UNIX_EPOCH).unwrap().as_secs();

// Convert the timestamp to a string
let date_string = seconds.to_string();

println!("Current date and time: {}", date_string);
```

This will output the current date and time in seconds since January 1, 1970. Keep in mind that this is just one example and there are many different ways to convert a date into a string in Rust.

## Deep Dive

The need to convert a date into a string is not a new concept in programming. In the past, this was often done by manually converting each date component (year, month, day, etc.) into a corresponding string representation. However, with modern programming languages like Rust, there are more efficient and standardized ways to accomplish this task.

In addition to using the `to_string()` method shown in the example above, another approach to converting a date into a string in Rust is by using the `format!()` macro. This allows for more control over the formatting of the date and can be useful when dealing with dates in different locales or timezones.
