## What & Why?

Rounding a number means adjusting it to the nearest whole number or to a specified degree of precision. Programmers often round numbers to make them easier to read and work with, especially when dealing with floating-point imprecision or when a specific precision is necessary for calculations or output formatting.

## How to:

Rust makes rounding straightforward with built-in methods on floating-point types. Here's how to do it:

```rust
fn main() {
    let num = 3.65;

    // Rounding to the nearest whole number
    let rounded = num.round();
    println!("Rounded: {}", rounded); // Outputs: Rounded: 4
    
    // Rounding down (floor)
    let floored = num.floor();
    println!("Floored: {}", floored); // Outputs: Floored: 3

    // Rounding up (ceil)
    let ceiled = num.ceil();
    println!("Ceiled: {}", ceiled); // Outputs: Ceiled: 4

    // Truncating (removing the fractional part)
    let truncated = num.trunc();
    println!("Truncated: {}", truncated); // Outputs: Truncated: 3
}
```

## Deep Dive

Rounding numbers is not unique to Rust; itâ€™s a common feature in many programming languages. Historically, the need for rounding comes from the fact that certain fractional values cannot be represented precisely in binary, leading to floating-point imprecision. 

In Rust, the `f32` and `f64` types represent floating-point numbers and provide several methods for rounding. These methods include `round`, `floor`, `ceil`, and `trunc`, each serving a unique purpose. The `round` method follows the "round half to even" strategy, which is a commonly used technique in mathematics and computer science for minimizing cumulative error.

Alternatives to the built-in methods can also be used, such as custom functions for rounding to a specific number of decimal places or implementing different rounding strategies (e.g., "round half up").

When it comes to implementation, the rounding methods internally rely on the IEEE 754 standard, which defines arithmetic for floating-point numbers. Rust ensures that these methods abide by the standard, providing consistent and predictable results across platforms.
