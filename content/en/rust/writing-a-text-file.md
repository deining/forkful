## Why 

Writing text files is a common task in programming. It allows for easy storage and retrieval of data that can be read and edited by humans. In this blog post, we will explore how to write a text file in Rust programming language.

## How To

To write a text file in Rust, we first need to create a File object using the `File::create()` method. This method takes in the path to the file as a parameter and returns a `Result` enum, which contains either a `File` object or an error value. Let's see an example: 

```
Rust
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::prelude::*;

let file_path = "sample.txt";
let mut file = match File::create(file_path) {
    Ok(file) => file,
    Err(error) => panic!("Unable to create {}: {}", file_path, error),
};

```

Next, we need to write our data to the file using the `write_all()` method, which also takes in a `Result` enum. This method writes the entire buffer to the file. Let's see an example:

```
Rust
let data = b"Welcome to my Rust programming blog post!";
match file.write_all(data) {
    Ok(_) => println!("Data successfully written to the file."),
    Err(error) => println!("Unable to write data to the file: {}", error)
};
```

Lastly, we need to handle any errors that may occur during the writing process. This can be done using the `expect()` method, which will panic if an error is encountered. Let's see an example:

```
Rust
file.write_all(data).expect("Unable to write data to the file.");
```

Once we have finished writing our data and handling errors, we need to close the file using the `close()` method. This ensures that any remaining data in the buffer is written to the file before it is closed. Let's see an example:

```
Rust
match file.close() {
    Ok(_) => println!("File closed successfully."),
    Err(error) => println!("Unable to close the file: {}", error)
};
```

## Deep Dive 

When writing a text file in Rust, there are a few things to keep in mind. The `File::create()` method is a generic method, which means it can create any type of file. This is why we need to specify the file path and extension in the method. Additionally, the `write_all()` method expects a `&[u8]` type data, which is why we have used the byte string literal (`b""`) in our example. 

Furthermore, Rust also provides us with the `writeln()` method, which is similar to `write_all()` but adds a newline character at the end of the buffer. It is useful when writing multiple lines of data to a file.
