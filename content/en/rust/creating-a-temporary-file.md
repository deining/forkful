## Why

In the world of programming, temporary files are often used for various reasons. Whether it is for storing data during a program's execution, or for temporary backups, having the ability to create and manage temporary files is a useful skill for any developer. In this blog post, we will explore how to create temporary files in Rust and why you might want to use them.

## How To

Creating a temporary file in Rust is fairly straightforward. We first import the necessary modules, including `std::fs`, which provides functions for file system operations, and `std::io::prelude`, which gives us access to `Read` and `Write` traits. Then, using the `tempfile` crate, we can create a new temporary file by calling the `NamedTempFile::new()` function. This will create a file in the default temporary directory and return a `NamedTempFile` object.

```Rust
use std::fs;
use std::io::prelude::*;
use tempfile::NamedTempFile;

let mut file = NamedTempFile::new().expect("Failed to create temporary file.");
```

We can then use this `file` object to write data to the temporary file, similar to how we would write to a regular file in Rust. Let's create a simple `write_to_file()` function that takes in a `NamedTempFile` object and writes a string to it.

```Rust
fn write_to_file(file: &mut NamedTempFile) {
    // Write some data to the file
    let data = "This is some sample text.";
    file.write_all(data.as_bytes()).expect("Failed to write to file.");
}
```

Now let's call this function and then read from the temporary file to see the result.

```Rust
write_to_file(&mut file);

// Read from the temporary file
let mut contents = String::new();
file.read_to_string(&mut contents).expect("Failed to read from file.");
println!("{}", contents);
```

This should output the following:

```
This is some sample text.
```

Once we are finished using the temporary file, we can either delete it manually by calling `file.close()` or wait for it to be automatically deleted when the program ends.

## Deep Dive

Creating temporary files in Rust may seem like a simple task, but there are a few important details to keep in mind. The `NamedTempFile` object we create using the `tempfile` crate will automatically be deleted once it goes out of scope. This ensures that temporary files are not left behind and cluttering up the filesystem.

Another advantage of using `tempfile` instead of manually creating and managing temporary files is that it handles cross-platform compatibility and error handling for us. In addition, the `NamedTempFile` object also provides methods for renaming the temporary file and retrieving its path.
