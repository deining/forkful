## Why
Creating temporary files in programming can be useful for many reasons. It allows us to store temporary data that is only needed for a short period of time, without cluttering up our main files or directory. In Rust, using temporary files can also help with memory management and performance.

## How To
To create a temporary file in Rust, we can use the `tempfile` crate. First, let's add the `tempfile` dependency to our `Cargo.toml` file:

```
[dependencies]
tempfile = "3.1"
```

Next, we can use the `tempfile::Builder` struct to specify the desired properties of our temporary file, such as the file name and extension. Let's create a temp file with the name "hello" and the `.txt` extension:

```
use tempfile::Builder;

let temp_file = Builder::new()
    .prefix("hello")
    .suffix(".txt")
    .tempfile()
    .expect("Failed to create temp file");
```

We can also customize the location of our temporary file by specifying a specific directory using the `.rand_in()` method. Here's an example of creating a temp file in the user's home directory:

```
use std::path::Path;

let temp_file = Builder::new()
    .rand_in(Path::new("/home/user/"))
    .tempfile()
    .expect("Failed to create temp file");
```

Once we are done using the temporary file, we can call the `.close()` method to close and delete the file. This will also delete the file automatically if it goes out of scope.

```
let temp_file = Builder::new()
    .tempfile()
    .expect("Failed to create temp file");

// Do something with the temp file

temp_file.close().expect("Failed to close temp file");
```

## Deep Dive
Behind the scenes, the `tempfile` crate creates a file in the system's temporary directory and then removes it when the `tempfile::NamedTempFile` struct is dropped. The location of the temporary directory may vary depending on the operating system.

There are also other methods in the `tempfile::Builder` struct that allow us to specify the desired permissions of the temporary file, such as `.mode()` and `.with_extension()`. Check out the `tempfile` crate documentation for more information on these methods.
