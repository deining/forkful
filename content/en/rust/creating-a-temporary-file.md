## What & Why?

Creating a temporary file in programming refers to generating a file that will only exist temporarily and will be deleted once its purpose is served. Programmers often do this in order to store and retrieve data in a temporary setting without cluttering their system with unnecessary files.

## How to:

Creating a temporary file in Rust is a straightforward process using the `tempfile` crate. First, we need to add the `tempfile` dependency in our `Cargo.toml` file:

```Rust
[dependencies]
tempfile = "3.1.0"
```

Next, we can use the `tempfile::Builder` struct to create a temporary file and specify its name and location:

```Rust
use tempfile::Builder;
let temp_file = Builder::new().suffix(".txt").tempfile().unwrap();
```

Finally, we can write data to the temporary file and retrieve its path:

```Rust
use std::io::Write;
temp_file.write_all(b"Hello World!").unwrap();
let path = temp_file.path();
println!("Temporary file path: {}", path.display());
```

Running this code will generate a temporary file with a `.txt` extension in the system's temporary directory. The program will also print out the path of the temporary file, which we can use to access the data written to it.

## Deep Dive:

Historically, creating temporary files was a common practice in programming, but with the advancement of memory management and multi-threading, it has become less popular. Another alternative to creating temporary files is using in-memory data structures, which can improve performance and avoid cluttering the system with unnecessary files.

In Rust, the `tempfile` crate uses a unique naming convention to ensure that temporary file names do not conflict with existing files on the system. It also uses the operating system's temporary file directory by default, but this can be changed if needed.
