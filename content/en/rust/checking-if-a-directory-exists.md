## What & Why?
Checking if a directory exists is a common task in programming that involves verifying if a specific directory exists in the file system. This is often done by programmers to ensure the proper functioning of their program, as well as to handle any errors that may occur if the directory is missing.

## How to:
To check if a directory exists in Rust, we can use the ```PathBuf``` and ```Path``` structs from the standard library. First, we need to import the ```Path``` trait using ```use std::path::Path```. Then, we can use the ```PathBuf``` to create a new path and pass it into the ```Path::new()``` method. Finally, we can use the ```Path::exists()``` method to check if the directory exists. Here's an example code snippet and its output:

```Rust
use std::path::Path;

let path = Path::new("path/to/directory");
if path.exists() {
    println!("The directory exists!");
} else {
    println!("The directory does not exist.");
}
```

```
The directory exists!
```

## Deep Dive:
In the past, checking if a directory exists was done using potentially dangerous methods, such as creating a temporary file in the directory and then deleting it. This could potentially cause issues with permissions or space on the disk. However, with the introduction of the ```exists()``` method in the ```Path``` struct, this process has become much simpler and safer.

There are also alternatives to using ```Path::exists()```, such as the ```fs::metadata()``` function which returns a ```Result``` enum indicating if the directory exists or not. Additionally, some crates, such as ```std::fs``` and ```walkdir```, provide more advanced options for traversing and checking directories.

Internally, the ```exists()``` method uses the ```stat()``` system call to check the directory's metadata, which includes information about its existence. This process is cross-platform, meaning it will work on any operating system supported by Rust.
