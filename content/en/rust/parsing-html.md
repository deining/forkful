## Why

HTML is the backbone of the modern internet. Every website, from simple blogs to complex web applications, is built on HTML. As a developer, it is important to have a strong understanding of HTML and how to manipulate it. One of the most common tasks in web development is parsing HTML, which is the process of extracting and manipulating data from HTML documents. In this blog post, we will explore how to parse HTML using the Rust programming language.

## How To

To start parsing HTML in Rust, we first need to add the `html5ever` crate to our `Cargo.toml` file:

```
[dependencies]
html5ever = "0.24.0"
```

Next, we can create a new Rust file and import the `html5ever` crate:

```
use html5ever::parse_document;
```

Now, let's create a simple HTML document to parse:

```
let html = r#"
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Rust Programming Blog</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Welcome to my blog!</h1>
        <p>This is a blog post on how to parse HTML in Rust.</p>
    </body>
</html>
"#;
```

We can then use the `parse_document` function to parse our HTML document into a `Document` object:

```
let document = parse_document(html);
```

To extract data from our HTML document, we can use the `select` method provided by the `html5ever` crate. This allows us to select elements based on CSS selectors. For example, to select the title of our blog post, we can use the following code:

```
let title = document.select("title").next().unwrap();
println!("Title: {}", title);
```

This will print out the title of our blog post, which in this case is "Rust Programming Blog".

## Deep Dive

Now that we have the basics of parsing HTML in Rust, let's dive deeper into the process. HTML is a complex language, with many different elements and attributes. In order to manipulate an HTML document effectively, we need to understand its structure and how to access specific elements.

One way to access specific elements in an HTML document is by using CSS selectors, as shown in the previous section. CSS selectors allow us to target specific elements based on their tag name, class, or ID. However, there are also other methods available in the `html5ever` crate, such as `find`, `find_from`, and `next_sibling`.

The `find` method allows us to find elements by tag name, while the `find_from` method searches for elements from a specific starting point in the document. The `next_sibling` method allows us to select the next element on the same level. These methods provide different ways to traverse and manipulate an HTML document.
