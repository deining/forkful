## Why
Reading and manipulating text files is a common task in many programming languages, including Rust. Whether it's for data processing, file management, or parsing information from a website, knowing how to handle text files is a valuable skill for any Rust programmer.

## How To
To read a text file in Rust, we first need to open the file and store it in a `File` object. We can do this using the `std::fs::File` module and the `File::open()` method. We also need to specify the file path and open mode, which can be `ReadOnly` or `ReadWrite` depending on our needs.

```
Rust
let file = match File::open("sample.txt", OpenOptions::new().read(true)) {
    Ok(f) => f,
    Err(e) => panic!("Error: {}", e),
};
```

Once we have opened the file, we can use the `std::io::BufReader` module to read its contents into a buffer. This allows for more efficient reading, especially for large files. We also need to specify the buffer size, which in this case is set to 1024 bytes.

```
Rust
let mut reader = BufReader::with_capacity(1024, file);
let mut buffer = String::new();
```

We can then use the `std::io::Read` trait to read from the buffer and store the contents in a string variable. The `read_to_string()` method reads the entire buffer until the end of the file is reached.

```
Rust
reader.read_to_string(&mut buffer).unwrap();
```

Finally, we can print the contents of the file to the console using the `println!()` macro.

```
Rust
println!("File contents:\n{}", buffer);
```

Running this code will output the contents of the file, making it easy to see if our file has been read correctly.

## Deep Dive
Now, let's dive a bit deeper into reading text files in Rust. In the above example, we read the entire file into memory before printing it to the console. This approach may not be suitable for large files, as it can cause our program to consume a lot of memory.

To avoid this issue, we can use the `lines()` method from the `std::io::BufRead` trait to read the file line by line. This way, we can process each line individually without storing the entire contents of the file in memory.

```
Rust
for line in reader.lines() {
    println!("{}", line.unwrap());
}
```

We can also use the `read_line()` method to read a file line by line and store each line in a vector. This allows for more advanced manipulation of the file's contents.

```
Rust
let mut lines = Vec::new();
for line in reader.lines() {
    lines.push(line.unwrap());
}
```

Additionally, Rust provides error handling functionalities to deal with potential issues while reading a file. We can use the `std::io::Error` module to handle errors that may occur during file operations.

```
Rust
use std::io::Error;
match reader.read_to_string(&mut buffer) {
    Ok(_) => println!("File read successfully"),
    Err(e) => match e.kind() {
        ErrorKind::PermissionDenied => println!("You do not have the necessary permissions"),
        ErrorKind::NotFound => println!("File not found"),
        _ => println!("Error: {:?}", e)
    }
}
```

Remember to always check for errors when reading files to prevent unexpected behavior in our programs.
