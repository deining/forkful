## Why

You might be wondering why anyone would want to read a text file using Rust. Well, for starters, it's a versatile and reliable programming language that can handle a variety of tasks, including file manipulation. In this article, we'll show you how to use Rust to read a text file with ease.

## How To

Reading a text file in Rust is a straightforward process. First, you'll need to create a new project by opening your terminal and typing:

```Rust
cargo new read_text_file
```

This will create a new folder named "read_text_file" with all the necessary files for your Rust project. Next, navigate to this folder and open the "src" folder. Inside, you'll find a file called "main.rs". This is where we'll write our code.

Now, let's open a text file using Rust. First, we'll need to import the `std::fs` library by adding the following line to the top of our code:

```Rust
use std::fs;
```

Next, we'll use the `fs::read_to_string()` function to read the contents of our text file. This function takes in the name of the file as a parameter and returns a `Result` object. Let's store this result in a variable named `file_contents`:

```Rust
let file_contents = fs::read_to_string("my_file.txt");
```

Now, we can use pattern matching to handle any errors that may occur while reading the file:

```Rust
match file_contents {
    Ok(contents) => println!("{}", contents), //Print the file contents if there are no errors
    Err(error) => println!("Error reading file: {}", error), //Print the error message if an error occurs
}
```

And that's it! Running our code will print out the contents of our file to the terminal.

## Deep Dive

Behind the scenes, the `fs::read_to_string()` function uses a combination of various low-level file I/O functions to efficiently read the file's contents. It also handles errors and returns a `Result` object, which is a common pattern in Rust.

Additionally, the `fs` library also provides other useful functions for reading files, such as `fs::read()` for reading binary files and `fs::metadata()` for retrieving information about a file, such as its size and permissions.
