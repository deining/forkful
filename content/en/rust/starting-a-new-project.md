## What & Why?

Starting a new project in Rust means creating a new codebase that you can work on and develop into a functional program. Programmers often start new projects to solve a problem or create a tool that can be used for a specific purpose.

## How to:

### Creating a new project

To create a new project in Rust, you can use the `cargo new` command followed by the name of your project. This will create a new directory with the given name and initialize it as a Rust project. 

```Rust
cargo new my_project
```

### Compiling and running your project

Once your project is created, you can use the `cargo build` command to compile it. This will create an executable in the `target/debug` directory within your project. To run your program, you can use the `cargo run` command.

```Rust
cargo build
cargo run
```

### Adding dependencies

Rust has a package manager called Cargo that allows you to easily add dependencies to your project. You can use the `cargo add` command followed by the name of the package you want to add.

```Rust
cargo add rand
```

## Deep Dive

### Historical Context

Rust was created by Mozilla in 2010 and has gained popularity in recent years due to its focus on memory safety and performance. It was designed to be a systems programming language, meaning it is used for low-level tasks such as operating systems or device drivers.

### Alternatives

There are various alternatives to Rust for starting new projects, such as Python, JavaScript, or Java. However, Rust's unique features, such as its strong type system and memory safety, make it a popular choice for certain types of projects.

### Implementation Details

Rust has a syntax that is similar to C++, but with additional features such as memory safety and functional programming concepts. It uses a concept called "ownership" to manage memory, making it less prone to common bugs such as dangling pointers or data races.
