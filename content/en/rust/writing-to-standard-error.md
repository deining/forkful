## Why 

In the world of programming, there are many different methods for displaying errors and messages to the user. One commonly used method is writing to standard error, also known as `stderr`. In this blog post, we will explore why writing to standard error can be a useful tool for Rust developers.

## How To 
Writing to standard error in Rust is a simple process that can greatly improve the readability and usability of your code. Let's take a look at an example of how to write to `stderr` using the `eprintln!()` macro:

```Rust
let error_message = "Something went wrong!";
eprintln!("{}", error_message);
```

This will print the message "Something went wrong!" to the standard error output. In comparison, using the `println!()` macro would print the message to the standard output. This may seem like a minor difference, but it can be very helpful when debugging your code.

Another advantage of writing to standard error is that it provides a clearer separation between error messages and regular output. This can make it easier for users to identify and troubleshoot any issues that may arise.

## Deep Dive 
When writing to standard error, Rust uses the `std::io::stderr()` function to access the standard error stream. This function returns a `Stderr` type, which implements the `Write` trait. This means that we can use methods like `write()` and `flush()` to write to the standard error stream.

In some cases, you may also need to handle I/O errors when writing to standard error. To do this, you can use the `expect()` method, which returns a `Result` type that contains an `Err` value if an error occurs.

Additionally, it is important to note that writing to standard error is not limited to simple text messages. You can also write any type that implements the `Display` trait, such as structs or enums, to standard error using the `eprintln!()` macro.
