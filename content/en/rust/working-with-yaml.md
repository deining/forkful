## What & Why?
Working with YAML in Rust refers to the process of using the YAML file format in your Rust applications. YAML is a human-readable data serialization language that is commonly used for configuration files and data storage. Programmers often use YAML because it allows for easy storage and retrieval of structured data in a human-friendly format.

## How to:
To work with YAML in Rust, you first need to add the `yaml-rust` crate to your project's dependencies. Then, you can use the `Yaml` type to load a YAML file into your application. Take a look at the following code example:

```Rust
// Import the necessary crate
use yaml_rust::YamlLoader;

// Define your YAML file as a string
let yaml = "
name: John
age: 25
";

// Load the YAML file as a vector of Yaml objects
let docs = YamlLoader::load_from_str(yaml).unwrap();

// Accessing the data
let name = &docs[0]["name"];
let age = &docs[0]["age"];

// Print the data to the console
println!("Name: {}", name);
println!("Age: {}", age);
```
**Output:**
```
Name: John
Age: 25
```
The `YamlLoader` allows us to easily parse the YAML file and access its data. You can also deserialize the YAML data into a custom struct using the `serde_yaml` crate.

## Deep Dive:
YAML stands for "YAML Ain't Markup Language" and was first released in 2001. It was designed with the goal of being human-readable and easily understandable by both humans and machines. Some alternatives to YAML include JSON, TOML, and XML.

The `yaml-rust` crate is an implementation of the YAML 1.2 spec for Rust. This crate provides a fast and easy way to work with YAML files in your applications. It is also actively maintained and has good documentation.
