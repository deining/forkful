## Why

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a crucial element of web development, as it is used to structure and present content on a website. Whether you are a web developer, data analyst, or simply interested in learning more about programming, understanding how to parse HTML can be a valuable skill. In this blog post, we will explore why parsing HTML is important and how to do it using Kotlin.

## How To

Parsing HTML essentially means extracting relevant data from an HTML document. To do this, we will use a library called "kotlinx.html" which provides useful functions for interacting with HTML documents.

First, we need to add this library as a dependency in our project. In the "build.gradle" file, add the following line in the dependencies block:

```Kotlin 
implementation "org.jsoup:jsoup:1.12.1"
```

Next, we can use the library to retrieve an HTML document from a URL and parse it using the "parse" method.

```Kotlin
val doc = URL("https://www.example.com").readText()
val parsed = parse(doc)
```

We can now use the "select" method to retrieve specific elements from the HTML document, using CSS selectors.

```Kotlin
val title = parsed.select("h1").text()
val paragraphs = parsed.select("p").eachText()
```

Once we have the desired elements, we can manipulate or process them further according to our needs.

## Deep Dive

While the above example shows a basic use case for parsing HTML using Kotlin, there are many more features and techniques that can be explored. For instance, we can use the "select" method with more complex CSS selectors to retrieve specific elements within a document.

Additionally, the "kotlinx.html" library also allows us to convert an HTML document into a DOM (Document Object Model) tree, which can be used for traversing and manipulating the document more efficiently.
