## Why

YAML, or Yet Another Markup Language, has been gaining popularity in the developer community due to its simplicity and readability. It is a human-friendly data serialization format that is used for storing and transferring data between applications. In this blog post, we will explore why YAML is a great option for developers and how it can be implemented in Kotlin.

## How To

To start working with YAML in Kotlin, we need to import the corresponding library in our project's build file. For Gradle, we can add the dependency in the `build.gradle` file as follows:

```
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.fasterxml.jackson.dataformat:jackson-dataformat-yaml:2.12.1'
}
```

Once the dependency is added, we can use the `ObjectMapper` class from Jackson library to read and write YAML files. Here's an example of how we can read a YAML file and convert it into a Kotlin data class:

```
// YAML file content:
// name: John
// age: 25

data class Person(val name: String, val age: Int)

val mapper = ObjectMapper(YAMLFactory())
val person: Person = mapper.readValue(File("person.yaml"), Person::class.java)
println(person.name) // Outputs: John
println(person.age) // Outputs: 25
```

We can also convert a Kotlin data class into a YAML file using the `writeValue()` method from the `ObjectMapper` class:

```
val person = Person("Jane", 30)
mapper.writeValue(File("person.yaml"), person)
```

This will create a YAML file with the following content:

```
name: Jane
age: 30
```

## Deep Dive

YAML supports various data types such as strings, integers, booleans, and arrays. It also allows for nested structures, making it a very versatile format. One of its unique features is the ability to use anchors and aliases, which can help in reducing redundancy in large data structures.

YAML also has support for comments, making it easier to document and understand the data. It is also human-friendly, meaning it can be easily read and edited without the use of specialized tools.

While working with YAML in Kotlin, it is important to handle exceptions like `InvalidFormatException` and `JsonMappingException` that may occur due to incorrect formatting or mismatch of data types. Jackson library provides methods like `enable(DeserializationFeature.FAIL_ON_UNKNOWN_PROPERTIES)` to handle such exceptions.

YAML can be a great option for developers looking for a human-friendly and versatile data format. With the help of Jackson library, it becomes even easier to integrate YAML in Kotlin projects. So, next time you need to store or transfer data, give YAML a try!
