## Why

Writing tests is an important aspect of software development. It allows developers to ensure that their code works as intended and catches potential bugs or errors before they become larger issues. By writing tests, developers can have more confidence in the reliability and functionality of their code.

## How To

To write tests in Kotlin, you will need to use a testing framework such as JUnit. Here is an example of a simple test in Kotlin:

```Kotlin
import org.junit.Test
import kotlin.test.assertEquals

class CalculatorTest {

    @Test
    fun testAddition() {
        assertEquals(4, Calculator.add(2, 2))
        assertEquals(10, Calculator.add(5, 5))
    }
}

object Calculator {

    fun add(num1: Int, num2: Int): Int {
        return num1 + num2
    }
}
```

In this example, we are testing the `add` function of a `Calculator` object. We use the `@Test` annotation to mark this function as a test, and the `assertEquals` function to compare the expected result with the actual result. Running this test will show us that both assertions are true, meaning that our `add` function is working correctly.

## Deep Dive

In addition to using a testing framework, there are some key practices to keep in mind when writing tests in Kotlin. First, it's important to have good test coverage, meaning that all aspects of your code should be tested. This includes testing edge cases and handling unexpected input, as well as the expected functionality.

Another important aspect of testing in Kotlin is to keep your tests organized and readable. This can be achieved by using descriptive test names and separating your tests into different classes or packages based on their functionality. This makes it easier to identify and fix any errors that may arise.

Lastly, using tools such as mock objects and dependency injection can aid in writing effective tests. Mock objects simulate real objects and help isolate the code being tested. Dependency injection allows for easier testing by allowing different implementations of dependencies to be used in tests.
