## What & Why?

Starting a new project in programming is the process of creating a brand new software application from scratch. This means writing the code, designing the user interface, and implementing any necessary functionality. Programmers start new projects for a variety of reasons, such as creating a new product, improving existing software, or simply learning a new technology.

## How to:

To start a new Kotlin project, follow these steps:

1. Install the Kotlin programming language on your computer by downloading it from the official website or using a package manager.
2. Open your preferred code editor or IDE.
3. Create a new Kotlin project by selecting the appropriate option from the menu or by running a command in the terminal.
4. Write your code within the `main` function, which serves as the entry point for your application.
5. To run your code, either use the `Run` button in your IDE or compile and execute it using the terminal or command line.

Example code:

```Kotlin
fun main() {
  println("Hello, World!")
}
```

Expected output:

```
Hello, World!
```

## Deep Dive:

Starting a new project is a crucial step in the software development process. It allows programmers to build new solutions and bring their ideas to life. In the past, creating a new software application required a lot of effort and time, as everything had to be built from scratch. However, with the rise of modern programming languages like Kotlin, starting a new project has become much easier and more efficient.

Alternative ways of starting a new project include using templates or frameworks to jumpstart the development process, or using a different programming language altogether. However, Kotlin offers benefits such as concise and readable syntax, strong type checking, and interoperability with Java, making it a popular choice among programmers.

When starting a new Kotlin project, programmers also have the option to use either the official command-line compiler or an IDE like IntelliJ or Android Studio. These tools provide a comprehensive development environment and offer additional features such as code completion, debugging, and code refactoring.
