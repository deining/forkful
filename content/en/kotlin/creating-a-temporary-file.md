## What & Why?
Creating a temporary file refers to generating a unique file that is used temporarily during a program's execution. This temporary file helps programmers store and retrieve data in a more efficient manner, improving the overall functionality of their code.

## How to:
```Kotlin 
// Import the necessary packages
import java.io.File
import java.io.IOException

// Create a new temporary file
val tempFile = File.createTempFile("prefix", "suffix")

// Write data to the temporary file
tempFile.writeText("This is the data to be written.")

// Read data from the temporary file
val data = tempFile.readText()

// Delete the temporary file once it is no longer needed
tempFile.delete()
```

Sample output:
The temporary file "tempFile" is successfully created with the prefix "prefix" and suffix "suffix". The data "This is the data to be written." is written to the file and can be retrieved through the "data" variable. After the data is read, the temporary file is deleted.

## Deep Dive:
Creating temporary files has been a common practice for programmers since the early days of computer programming. It offers a simple and efficient way to handle data during program execution without having to constantly access the main file or database. This in turn improves the performance and speed of the code.

There are other alternatives to using temporary files such as in-memory data structures or databases, but they may not always be the most optimal choice depending on the situation. Temporary files provide a middle ground, as they are not constantly stored in memory but can still be accessed quickly when needed.

In terms of implementation, creating a temporary file involves generating a unique name for the file and creating it in a designated temporary directory. This prevents any conflicts with existing files and ensures the temporary file is deleted once it is no longer needed.
