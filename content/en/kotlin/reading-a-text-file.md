## Why

Reading and writing text files is a crucial aspect of programming, especially in Kotlin. Whether you're creating a document or manipulating data, the ability to read and write text files is a valuable skill to have. This blog post will guide you on how to efficiently read text files in Kotlin, so you can take your programming skills to the next level.

## How To

Reading a text file in Kotlin is a straightforward process. First, you need to create a File object that points to the location of your text file. This can be achieved using the `java.io.File` class, which is also available in Kotlin. You can then use the `readText()` method to read the contents of the file as a string.

```Kotlin
val file = File("myFile.txt")
val text = file.readText()
```

If you want to read only certain lines in the file, you can use the `readLines()` method instead. This method returns a list of Strings, with each item representing a line in the text file.

```Kotlin
val file = File("myFile.txt")
val lines = file.readLines()

// print each line
for (line in lines) {
    println(line)
}
```

You can also use the `forEachLine()` method to read the lines of a file and perform a specific action for each line. This is useful when you want to manipulate the data in the file.

```Kotlin
val file = File("myFile.txt")
file.forEachLine {
    // perform action for each line
    // e.g. split the line by delimiter and store in a list
    val list = it.split(",")
}
```

## Deep Dive

Reading text files may seem simple, but there are a few things to keep in mind to make the process more efficient. First, it's important to close the file after reading it using the `close()` method. This ensures that system resources are freed up and available for other operations.

It's also a good practice to wrap your file reading code in a try-catch block to handle any potential exceptions. For example, if the file does not exist or cannot be accessed, an IOException will be thrown. By using a try-catch block, you can handle these exceptions gracefully and prevent your program from crashing.

Another important aspect to consider is the character encoding of the text file. If the file was created using a different encoding than the one your program is using, you may encounter errors or incorrect output. To avoid this, you can specify the desired encoding when creating the `File` object, using the `Charset` parameter.

```Kotlin
val file = File("myFile.txt", Charset.forName("UTF-8"))
val text = file.readText()
```
