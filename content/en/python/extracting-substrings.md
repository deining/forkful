## Why

Extracting substrings in Python can be a useful skill for any programmer to have. It allows you to work with smaller parts of a string, rather than the entire string itself. This can come in handy when you want to manipulate or analyze specific sections of text within a larger string.

## How To

To extract a substring in Python, we can use the built-in `slice()` function. Here's a simple example:

```Python
my_string = "Hello World"
substring = my_string[6:]
print(substring)
```
**Output: World**

In this example, we used the `slice` function to extract the substring starting at index 6 and continuing until the end of the string. The `slice` function takes in two arguments, the starting index and the ending index, separated by a colon. If the starting index is left blank, it will start at the beginning of the string. Similarly, if the ending index is left blank, it will go until the end of the string.

We can also specify a step size within the `slice` function to extract every nth character. Here's an example:

```Python
my_string = "Hello World"
substring = my_string[::2]
print(substring)
```
**Output: HloWrd**

In this example, we are starting at the beginning of the string and going until the end, with a step size of 2. This means that we are extracting every other character from the string.

## Deep Dive

When extracting substrings, it's important to keep in mind that indexing in Python starts at 0. This means that the first character of a string has an index of 0, the second character has an index of 1, and so on. This can sometimes cause confusion when trying to extract substrings, so it's important to pay close attention to the index values.

Additionally, the `slice` function is just one way to extract substrings in Python. Other methods such as using the `substring()` method or regular expressions can also be used, depending on your specific needs.
