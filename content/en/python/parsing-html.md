## Why
Many websites today contain a lot of data that is embedded in HTML code. This can make it difficult for developers to extract the specific information they need. This is where HTML parsing comes in handy â€“ it allows us to extract data from HTML code in a structured and organized manner.

## How To
To begin, we will need to import the "BeautifulSoup" library, which is a popular HTML parsing library for Python. We can install it using pip: 

```Python 
pip install beautifulsoup4
```

Once we have the library installed, we can create a BeautifulSoup object by passing in the HTML content and specifying the parser we want to use. Let's take a look at an example: 

```Python 
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# HTML content to be parsed
html = "<h1>Python Programming</h1><p>This is a blog post about Python programming.</p>"

# Creating a BeautifulSoup object
soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')

# Accessing specific elements
print(soup.h1) # Output: <h1>Python Programming</h1>
print(soup.p) # Output: <p>This is a blog post about Python programming.</p>

# Extracting text from specific elements
print(soup.h1.text) # Output: Python Programming
print(soup.p.text) # Output: This is a blog post about Python programming.
```

As you can see, we were able to easily access and extract specific elements from the HTML code using the BeautifulSoup library.

## Deep Dive
HTML parsing involves understanding the structure of HTML code and using specific tags and attributes to navigate and extract the desired data. The BeautifulSoup library provides multiple ways to search for specific elements, such as using the "find" and "find_all" methods. We can also use unique identifiers like class names or IDs to target specific elements.

Furthermore, HTML parsing becomes even more powerful when combined with other libraries, such as Requests for retrieving web pages and Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.

It's also important to note that HTML parsing can be used for more than just web scraping. It can also be helpful in extracting data from HTML emails or documents.
