## What & Why?
YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) is a human-readable data serialization language used for storing and transmitting data. Programmers use YAML for its simplicity, flexibility, and support for various programming languages.

## How to:
To work with YAML in Python, we first need to install the pyyaml library using pip. After installing, we can import the library using the ```import yaml``` statement. Then, we can use the ```dump()``` function to convert a Python data structure into YAML format and the ```load()``` function to convert YAML data into Python data.

```python
# importing the pyyaml library
import yaml
# defining a Python dictionary
my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
# converting to YAML format using dump()
yaml_data = yaml.dump(my_dict)
print(yaml_data)
# output: "a: 1\nb: 2\nc: 3\n"
# converting YAML data back to Python data using load()
python_data = yaml.load(yaml_data)
print(python_data)
# output: {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
```

## Deep Dive:
YAML was first released in 2001 and has gained popularity in recent years due to its human-readable format. It is commonly used for configuration files, but can also be used for messaging protocols and data storage. Alternatives to YAML include JSON and XML, but YAML is preferred for its ease of use and readability. YAML's implementation in Python is done through the use of the PyYAML library, which supports both Python 2 and 3.
