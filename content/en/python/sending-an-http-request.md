## What & Why?

Sending an HTTP request means making a request to a web server to retrieve information. Programmers use this to communicate with web servers and get data such as web pages, images, or files. It is an essential part of web development and allows us to access and use information from the internet.

## How to:

To send an HTTP request in Python, we can use the built-in `requests` library. First, we import the library using `import requests`. Then, we use the `get()` method to make a GET request to a specific URL. For example:

```Python
import requests
response = requests.get("https://www.example.com")
print(response.text)
```

This will send a request to the URL and print out the response data. We can also specify additional parameters such as headers or data to send with the request. For more information on the `requests` library, check out their official documentation.

## Deep Dive:

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) was created in 1989 and has since become the standard for communication between web servers and clients. In addition to GET requests, there are also other types of requests such as POST, PUT, and DELETE. These allow programmers to interact with web servers and update information, not just retrieve it.

There are also alternative methods for sending HTTP requests in Python, such as using the `urllib` library or the `httplib` library. However, the `requests` library is generally preferred for its simpler syntax and more user-friendly interface.

When we send an HTTP request, we are using the client-server model, where the client (our program) sends a request to the server (the web server) and waits for a response. This process involves several steps, including establishing a TCP connection, sending the request, and receiving the response.
