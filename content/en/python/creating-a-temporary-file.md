## What & Why?
Creating a temporary file is a common practice among programmers, where a file is created temporarily for a specific task and then deleted once that task is completed. This helps in managing and organizing files efficiently, as well as preventing cluttering of the main system files. Temporary files are also used for storing temporary data that needs to be discarded after its use, saving memory space and increasing the overall performance of the program.

## How to:
```python
# Import the tempfile module
import tempfile

# Create a temporary file using NamedTemporaryFile()
temp_file = tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile()

# Write data to the temporary file
temp_file.write(b"This is a temporary file created using Python")

# Close the file
temp_file.close()

# Verify if the temporary file has been created by printing the file name
print(temp_file.name)

# Output: C:\\Users\\User\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\tmpnzxewedw

# After the task is completed, the temporary file will automatically be deleted
```

## Deep Dive:
- The concept of temporary files has been around since the early days of computing and is used in many programming languages, including Python.
- Apart from the NamedTemporaryFile() function, the tempfile module also provides other methods for creating temporary files, such as TemporaryFile() and mkstemp().
- In some cases, temporary files are used as an alternative to named pipes, depending on the specific needs of a program. 
- The tempfile module helps in creating temporary files that are platform-independent, ensuring that the code works on different operating systems.
