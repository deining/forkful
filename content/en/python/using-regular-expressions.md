## What & Why?

Regular expressions are a way to search for and manipulate text strings by using specific patterns. Programmers use regular expressions to efficiently search, match, and manipulate strings of text or data. It's a powerful tool for data cleaning, text parsing, and data extraction.

## How to:

To use regular expressions in Python, you need to import the `re` module. Once imported, you can use the built-in `re` functions to search and manipulate strings.

```Python
import re

# Let's define a simple string
text = "Hello World!"

# Use the search function to check if "World" is present in the string
if re.search("World", text):
  print("Found it!")

# Replace "Hello" with "Hi" in the string
new_text = re.sub("Hello", "Hi", text)
print(new_text) # Outputs: Hi World!
```

## Deep Dive

Regular expressions have been around since the 1950s, and they were first introduced by mathematician Stephen Kleene. They have since become an essential tool for text processing and manipulation in various programming languages.

While regular expressions are commonly used in Python, there are alternative libraries such as `regex` and `re2` that offer extended features and a different syntax. However, the `re` module in Python offers a user-friendly and powerful solution, making it a popular choice among programmers.

Regular expressions work by using special characters and metacharacters to define patterns that match specific strings. For example, the dot character `.` matches any single character, and the asterisk `*` matches any number of characters. These are just a couple of the many metacharacters available in regular expressions.
