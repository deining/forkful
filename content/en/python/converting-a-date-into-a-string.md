## What & Why?
Converting a date into a string is the process of changing a date object in Python to a human-readable string format. Programmers do it to display dates in a more readable format, make comparisons between dates, or storing dates in databases.

## How to:
Converting a date into a string is a simple process in Python. First, we need to import the datetime module, which is a built-in module in Python that allows us to work with dates and time. Then, we can use the ```datetime``` class to create a date object:

```Python
import datetime

date = datetime.datetime(2021, 2, 20)
```
Next, we can use the ```.strftime()``` method to convert the date object into a string with a specific format. We need to provide a format string to specify how we want the date to be displayed. For example, if we want the date to be displayed as "Feb 20 2021", we can use the following code:

```Python
date.strftime("%b %d %Y")
```

The output will be:

```Python
'Feb 20 2021'
```

## Deep Dive:
Converting a date into a string is a common task in programming, especially when working with dates and time. Before the ```datetime``` module was introduced in Python 2.3, the most common way to represent and manipulate dates was using the time module. However, with the introduction of the ```datetime``` module, converting dates into strings has become much easier and more efficient.

There are also alternative ways to convert a date into a string in Python, such as using the ```str()``` function or the ```.isoformat()``` method. However, these methods may not provide the flexibility to specify a specific date format.

The ```strftime()``` method follows the C language's ```strftime()``` function, which stands for "string format time". It allows us to create a custom format string to display the date in the desired format. This allows programmers to display dates in a familiar or consistent format across different applications.
