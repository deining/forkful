## What & Why?

Temporary files are temporary files created by programmers to store data temporarily during the execution of a program. These files are used to store data that is only needed for a short period of time and can be discarded once the program is finished.

## How to:

To create a temporary file in Elixir, we can use the [File] module's [open!] function. This function takes in a file path as a parameter and returns a tuple containing the file's handle and a temporary file path. The temporary file will automatically be deleted once the file handle is closed. 

Sample code:

```Elixir
{file_handle, temp_file_path} = File.open!( "my_temp_file.txt" )
File.write!(file_handle, "This is a temporary file created using Elixir!")
File.close(file_handle)
```

Sample output:

No output will be printed, but the temporary file "my_temp_file.txt" will be created in the current directory and will contain the text "This is a temporary file created using Elixir!".

## Deep Dive:

Temporary files have been a common practice in programming for a long time. They are commonly used for situations where data needs to be stored temporarily, such as caching, logging, or file transfers. 

An alternative to creating a temporary file is to use in-memory data structures such as Maps or Lists, which are faster but have limited capacity. Another alternative is to utilize a database, although this may introduce unnecessary complexity and potential performance issues.

The [File] module in Elixir handles the creation and management of temporary files. It uses the underlying OS's file system to create and delete temporary files. Additionally, the [Path] module can be used to manipulate file paths if needed.
