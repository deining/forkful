## What & Why?

Starting a new project in programming is the process of creating a new software or application from scratch. Programmers do this in order to build something new and unique that meets specific needs or solves a problem.

## How to:

To start a new project in Swift, first open up Xcode and create a new project. Next, select the type of project you want to create, such as a Single View App or a Game. Give your project a name and choose where to save it. Xcode will generate some starter code for you to begin with, including a basic user interface. From here, you can start writing your own code and building your project.

```Swift
import UIKit
// basic "Hello World" code
print("Hello World!")
```

Output: Hello World!

## Deep Dive:

Starting a new project in Swift is a common practice among programmers and developers. It allows them to create custom solutions for specific needs, rather than relying on pre-existing software. Swift, being a relatively new programming language, has gained popularity among developers due to its modern syntax and versatility.

Some alternatives to starting a new project in Swift include using other programming languages such as Java, Python, or Objective-C. However, Swift offers a more concise and easy-to-read syntax compared to these other languages.

When starting a new project in Swift, it's important to understand the fundamentals of the language, such as variables, data types, arrays, and functions. This will allow you to write efficient and effective code for your project.
