## Why

Writing tests may seem like an additional task to your already busy programming schedule, but it can greatly benefit your code in the long run. By writing tests, you can catch bugs earlier and ensure your code is functioning as intended. It also makes it easier to make changes and refactoring in the future.

## How To

Writing tests in Swift is relatively simple and can be done using the XCTest framework. Let's take a look at an example of testing a basic function that returns the sum of two numbers:

```
Swift func calculateSum(num1: Int, num2: Int) -> Int { return num1 + num2 }

XCTAssertEqual(calculateSum(num1: 5, num2: 7), 12, "Incorrect sum!") 
```

In this code block, we first define our function `calculateSum` which takes in two `Int` parameters and returns their sum. Then, using the `XCTAssertEqual` method, we test the function by passing in two numbers and making sure the output is equal to our expected value of 12. If the test passes, the console will show a success message, but if it fails, it will show the provided error message.

## Deep Dive

There are different types of tests that can be written, such as unit tests, integration tests, and UI tests. It's important to choose the appropriate type of test depending on the scenario. Additionally, using test-driven development (TDD) can be helpful in writing tests as it follows a cycle of writing a test, watching it fail, and then writing the code to make it pass.

Another approach to testing is using mocks, which are fake objects that can simulate real objects and their behaviors. This can be useful in testing code that depends on external services or APIs.
