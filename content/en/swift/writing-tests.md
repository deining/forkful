## What & Why?

Writing tests is the process of creating code that checks the functionality and correctness of your overall code. Programmers do this in order to catch any potential bugs or errors in their code before it is released to the public. It is an important practice in ensuring code quality and reducing the likelihood of issues being discovered by users.

## How to:

```Swift 
//Example of writing a basic test
func testAddition(){
  let result = 2 + 3
  if result == 5{
    print("Test Passed!")
  }
}
testAddition()
//Output: Test Passed!
```

To write a test in Swift, simply define a function that tests a specific aspect of your code, and within that function, use conditional statements to check if the result is as expected. Running the function will then output whether the test passed or failed. Writing multiple tests for different parts of your code can help pinpoint any potential errors.

## Deep Dive:

Testing has been around since the early days of programming, with the first formal software testing being used in the 1950s to test the functionality of punched card equipment. There are different types of testing, such as unit testing which focuses on testing small, individual units of code, and integration testing which tests how different units work together. There are also alternative methods of testing, such as manual testing, but writing automated tests is the preferred method for many developers as it saves time and effort in the long run.

When writing tests in Swift, there are various frameworks that can assist in the process, such as XCTest. These frameworks provide built-in functions and methods specifically designed for testing, making it a more streamlined and efficient process.
