## What & Why?

Substring extraction is the process of isolating a specific portion or a series of characters from a larger string. This is commonly done in programming to manipulate or analyze data within a string. For example, extracting a person's name from a full name string or extracting a specific date from a long string containing various information.

## How to:

To extract substrings in Swift, we can use the ```substring(from:to:)``` and ```substring(with:)``` methods. 

For example, let's say we have a string containing a person's full name: ```let name = "John Smith"```

To extract the first name, we can use ```substring(to: name.firstIndex(of: " ")!)```. This will return the substring "John".

To extract the last name, we can use ```substring(from: name.firstIndex(of: " ")!)```. This will return the substring "Smith".

To extract a portion of the string between two specified indices, we can use the ```substring(with:)``` method. For example, to extract the middle name "David" from the full name string, we can use ```substring(with: name.index(after: name.firstIndex(of: " ")!)..<name.lastIndex(of: " ")!)```.

The output for all of these examples would be the extracted substring as a new string.

## Deep Dive:

Substring extraction has been a common practice in programming since the early days of string manipulation. It provides a flexible and efficient way of handling and manipulating data within strings. There are other methods of extracting substrings, such as using regular expressions, but the methods provided by Swift are often simpler and more convenient.

It's important to note that the substring extraction methods in Swift use index values, which can get tricky at times. It's always a good idea to handle error cases, such as a substring being out of bounds, to avoid unexpected errors.
