## Why
Substrings are smaller parts of a larger string and extracting them can be useful for various tasks such as data processing, text manipulation, and string parsing. It allows for more efficient and precise handling of string data.

## How To
To extract substrings in Swift, we use the `substring` method. Here's an example of extracting a substring from a given string:

```
let string = "Hello, World!"

let substring = string.substring(from: 7, to: 12)

print(substring) // Outputs "World"
```

In this example, we use the `substring` method and pass in the `from` and `to` parameters, indicating the starting and ending index of the desired substring. Note that the starting index is inclusive, while the ending index is exclusive. 

We can also use the `substring` method with the `Range` type to extract a substring using a specific range of indices:

```
let string = "Swift is awesome!"

let range = string.startIndex..<string.index(string.startIndex, offsetBy: 5)

let substring = string.substring(with: range)

print(substring) // Outputs "Swift"
```

In this case, we first define a range of indices using the `startIndex` and `offsetBy` methods. Then, we pass that range to the `substring` method to extract the desired substring.

## Deep Dive
There are several other methods and properties that can be used to extract substrings in Swift. For example, the `prefix` and `suffix` methods can be used to extract the first or last n characters of a string. There is also a `range(of:)` property that can be used to find the range of a specific substring within a given string. Additionally, the `Substring` type can be used to manipulate and manipulate substrings without having to convert them into strings.

It's also worth noting that Swift strings are Unicode-compliant, meaning they can handle a wide range of characters and languages. This makes substring extraction in Swift more versatile and robust.
