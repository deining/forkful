# Why

YAML is a widely used format for storing and sharing data, making it a valuable tool for developers. It's commonly used in configurations and settings files, making it essential for those working with applications or systems that require frequent updates or customization.

# How To

To work with YAML in Swift, we first need to import the Yams library using the following code:

```
import Yams
```

Next, we can start using YAML in our code by creating a YAML string using the `YAMLEncoder` class:

```
let yamlString = try YAMLEncoder().encode(["name": "John", "age": 25])
```

We can then print the YAML string to see the output:

```
print(yamlString)
```

The output would look like this:

```
name: John
age: 25
```

We can also decode a YAML string to retrieve the data in Swift. For example:

```
let yamlString = "name: John\r\nage: 25"
let data = try YAMLDecoder().decode([String: Any].self, from: yamlString)
```

The output would be a dictionary containing the data:

```
["name": "John", "age": 25]
```

# Deep Dive

YAML stands for "YAML Ain't Markup Language" and is a human-friendly data serialization format. It's commonly used for configurations and has a simple syntax that is easier to read and write than other formats like XML or JSON.

One of the main advantages of YAML is its support for nested data structures, making it great for representing complex configurations. It also allows for comments, making it easier to document and maintain code.

It's worth noting that YAML is a superset of JSON, meaning any valid JSON document is also a valid YAML document. This makes it easy to switch between the two formats if needed.
