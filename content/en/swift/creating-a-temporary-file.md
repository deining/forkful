## What & Why?
Creating a temporary file is a way for programmers to store data that is only needed temporarily. It allows them to perform tasks such as saving user input or storing intermediate results without having to create permanent files, which can clutter up a project and be prone to errors.

## How to:
Creating a temporary file in Swift is a simple process. First, we need to import the ```Foundation``` framework, which contains the necessary functions. Then, we can use the ```NSTemporaryDirectory()``` function to get the path for the temporary directory on the user's device. After that, we can use this path in conjunction with the ```URL(fileURLWithPath: String)``` initializer to create a temporary file URL. Finally, we can use the ```write(to:atomically:encoding:)``` method to write data to the temporary file and the ```delete(atPath:)``` method to delete it when it is no longer needed.

Here's an example of a function that creates a temporary file and saves a string to it:

```Swift
func createTempFile() {
    // Import Foundation framework
    import Foundation
    
    // Get temporary directory path
    let temporaryDirectory = NSTemporaryDirectory()
    
    // Create temporary file URL
    let tempFileURL = URL(fileURLWithPath: temporaryDirectory).appendingPathComponent("tempFile.txt")
    
    // Write string to file
    try? "This is a temporary file.".write(to: tempFileURL, atomically: true, encoding: .utf8)
    
    // Delete file
    try? FileManager.default.deleteItem(at: tempFileURL)
}
```

## Deep Dive:
The concept of temporary files has been around since the early days of computing. In the past, they were used to store data when main memory (RAM) was limited. However, with the increasing availability of memory and storage space, the use of temporary files has shifted towards being a programming convenience.

There are alternatives to creating temporary files, such as using in-memory data structures or storing data in databases. However, temporary files can still be useful in certain situations, such as when dealing with large amounts of data or when the data is needed across different platforms.

When creating a temporary file, it is important to consider security measures to protect the sensitive information it may contain. This can include setting appropriate permissions and securely deleting the file after use.
