## Why
Reading and manipulating text files is a crucial skill in any programming language, including Swift. Being able to read and extract data from a text file can save you time and effort when working with large amounts of data. In this blog post, we'll dive into the basics of how to read a text file in Swift.

## How To
Reading a text file in Swift is a simple process. First, we need to create an instance of `FileManager` to access our file. Then, we'll use the `contents(atPath:)` method to read the contents of the file. Let's take a look at an example:

```
let fileManager = FileManager.default
if let data = fileManager.contents(atPath: "textfile.txt") {
    let text = String(data: data, encoding: .utf8)
    print(text)
}
```

In this example, we create an instance of `FileManager` and use its `contents(atPath:)` method to read the contents of the file named "textfile.txt". We then use the `String` initializer to convert this data into a readable format, and finally we print the contents to the console.

## Deep Dive
Let's take a deeper look at what's happening in this code. The `contents(atPath:)` method returns a `Data` object, which contains the raw data from our text file. We then use the `String` initializer with the `.utf8` encoding to convert this data into a readable format. Swift supports different types of encodings, so make sure to choose the appropriate one for your file.

Alternatively, we can use the `String` method `init(contentsOf:usedEncoding:)` to automatically detect the appropriate encoding for our file. This can be useful when working with files of unknown encoding.
