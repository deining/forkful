## Why

Writing a text file may seem like a simple task, but it can actually have a big impact on your programming experience. By creating structured and organized text files, you can easily store and access data within your program. This can lead to more efficient coding and ultimately, a better overall program.

## How To

To create a text file in Elm, you can use the `text` function from the `Html` library. This function takes in a string as its argument and returns a `Html Msg` that can be used to display the text on your webpage.

```
import Html exposing (text)

main =
  text "Hello, world!"
```

This code will display the text "Hello, world!" on your webpage. You can also use the `text` function with variables to display dynamic content.

```
import Html exposing (text)

name = "John"

main =
  text ("Hello, " ++ name ++ "!")
```

This will display the text "Hello, John!" on your webpage. You can also use `text` in conjunction with other HTML functions to create more complex displays.

## Deep Dive

In Elm, text files can also be used for localization and internationalization purposes. By storing all your text in one file, it becomes easier to translate and update your program for different languages.

Additionally, Elm has a built-in `toString` function that automatically converts values into strings. This can be useful when writing text files that contain data from variables or functions.
