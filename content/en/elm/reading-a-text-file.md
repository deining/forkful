## Why

If you're new to Elm, you may be wondering why you would even want to read a text file in your programming. There are a few reasons why you may want to do this, such as:

- Storing data for your application in a human-readable format
- Reading configuration files for your program
- Parsing data from an API response

In this blog post, we will explore how you can easily read a text file in your Elm applications.

## How To

Reading a text file in Elm involves a few steps:

1. First, we will need to import the `File` module from the `elm/file` package.
2. Then, we will use the `file` function to create a `File` object from a given file name. This function takes two arguments- the file name and the file's contents.
3. Next, we will use the `contents` function to extract the contents of the file as a `String`.
4. We can then use the `Debug.log` function to print the contents of the file to the console for debugging purposes.

```Elm
import File
import Debug

file : File
file = File.file "myFile.txt" "This is some text inside the file."

contents : String
contents = File.contents file

main : Program ()
main = 
  Debug.log "File contents:" contents
```

The above code will print "This is some text inside the file." to the console.

## Deep Dive

Behind the scenes, the `File.file` function creates an object with information about the file, such as its name and contents. This object follows the `File` type defined in the `elm/file` package. The `File.contents` function then looks for this `File` object and extracts its contents to be used in our program.

One thing to note is that reading files in Elm is limited to the browser environment, as it involves using the `File` and `FileReader` APIs provided by browsers. This means that we cannot read files on the server side.
