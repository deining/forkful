## What & Why?

Rounding a number is the process of tweaking its value to its nearest whole number or to a certain number of decimal places. Programmers round numbers to simplify them, typically for display purposes, calculation efficiency, or to meet certain numeric specifications where precision beyond a certain point is unnecessary.

## How to:

In Elm, rounding a number is straightforward and can be achieved using built-in functions. Here's a quick look at how you might do it.

```elm
import Basics exposing (round, floor, ceiling)

-- Round to nearest whole number
roundValue : Float -> Int
roundValue number =
  round number

-- Round down to nearest whole number
floorValue : Float -> Int
floorValue number =
  floor number

-- Round up to nearest whole number
ceilingValue : Float -> Int
ceilingValue number =
  ceiling number

-- Sample usage and output
roundValue 3.14    --> 3
floorValue 3.99    --> 3
ceilingValue 3.01  --> 4
```

Each function - `round`, `floor`, and `ceiling` - serves a different purpose, but they all revolve around the concept of rounding numbers.

## Deep Dive

Rounding numbers has been around long before computers. Historically, it's been part of everyday math, commerce, and engineering - think about how currency transactions always round to the nearest cent.

Within Elm, and programming in general, there are a few alternative approaches to rounding:

1. Directly using the functions provided by `Basics`.
2. Crafting a custom rounding function to handle specific cases or rounding rules.
3. Using a library/package that offers more complex rounding capabilities, such as different rounding strategies (e.g., bankers rounding, arithmetic rounding).

The implementation of rounding in Elm is based on the IEEE-754 standard for floating-point arithmetic, which is used by most modern programming languages. This ensures consistency across different platforms and languages for most rounding operations.

Be aware of the subtle differences between `round`, `floor`, and `ceiling`. `round` makes a number closer to the nearest integer. `floor` makes it smaller or equal to itself, while `ceiling` makes it larger or equal. Knowing which one to use depends on the context where the rounding is applied.
