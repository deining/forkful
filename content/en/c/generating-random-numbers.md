What & Why?

Generating random numbers is a fundamental concept in programming that involves generating a sequence of numbers without any discernible pattern. Programmers use this technique to add an element of unpredictability in their code, which is essential for a variety of tasks such as cryptography, simulations, and game development.

How to:

To generate random numbers in C, we use the `rand()` function from the standard library `stdlib.h`. This function returns a pseudo-random integer between 0 and `RAND_MAX`, which is a constant defined in `stdlib.h`. To generate a random number within a specified range, we can use the modulo operator (`%`) and add the minimum value of the range. Here's an example:
```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    int min = 10; // minimum value of the range
    int max = 20; // maximum value of the range
    int random_num = rand() % (max - min + 1) + min; // generate a random number between 10 and 20
    printf("Random number: %d\n", random_num);
    return 0;
}
```
Output:
```
Random number: 14
```

Deep Dive:

The concept of generating random numbers dates back to ancient times when rolling dice was considered a form of divination. In computer science, the term "pseudo-random" is used because the numbers generated by the `rand()` function are not truly random, but rather determined by a deterministic algorithm. Alternate methods for generating random numbers include hardware random number generators and true random number generators, which use unpredictable physical phenomena such as atmospheric noise.

Implementation details of the `rand()` function may vary depending on the compiler or operating system being used. And since the generated numbers are not truly random, they can exhibit bias and patterns if not properly seeded. This is why it is recommended to use the `srand()` function to provide a seed value before calling `rand()`. The seed value can be the current time or any other number, as long as it can change each time the program is executed.
