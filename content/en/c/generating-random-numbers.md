## Why

In programming, random numbers are used extensively for a variety of purposes such as generating unique IDs, simulating real-world scenarios, and implementing security measures. Generating random numbers can add an element of unpredictability and randomness to our code, making it more robust and efficient. In this blog post, we will explore the basics of generating random numbers in C programming.

## How To

There are several ways to generate random numbers in C. Let's take a look at some coding examples along with their output.

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <time.h>

int main()
{
    // Generate a random number between 1 and 10
    int num = rand() % 10 + 1;
    printf("Random number between 1 and 10: %d", num);

    // Seed the random number generator
    srand(time(NULL));

    // Generate a random number between 50 and 100
    int num2 = rand() % 51 + 50;
    printf("Random number between 50 and 100: %d", num2);
    
    return 0;
}
```
Output:
```
Random number between 1 and 10: 8
Random number between 50 and 100: 87
```

In the above code, we have used the `rand()` function from the `stdlib.h` library to generate random numbers. However, the generated numbers will always be the same each time the program is executed. To introduce an element of randomness, we use the `srand()` function from the `time.h` library to seed the random number generator.

## Deep Dive

The `rand()` function uses a pseudo-random algorithm to generate random numbers. The algorithm produces a sequence of numbers that appear to be random, but in reality, they are determined by a specific mathematical formula. This is why we need to seed the random number generator to get a different sequence of numbers in each run.

The `srand()` function takes a seed value as its argument, which is used to initialize the random number generator. When we use the current time as the seed value, we ensure that the sequence of numbers generated is unique each time the program is executed.

It's worth noting that even though the numbers generated by `rand()` may seem random to humans, they are not truly random and can be predicted by sophisticated algorithms. If we need a higher level of randomness, we should use a third-party library or external sources of randomness such as user input, network activity, or hardware noise.
