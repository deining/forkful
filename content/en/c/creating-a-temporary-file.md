## Why

Creating temporary files is a common practice in programming, especially in C. These files serve as temporary storage for data during runtime and can be useful in managing memory and improving performance. In this blog post, we will explore the reasons why creating temporary files is important and how to implement it in C.

## How To

Creating a temporary file in C is a simple process. We will be using the `tmpfile()` function from the `stdio.h` library. This function creates a temporary file in the default temporary directory and returns a `FILE` pointer to it.

First, we need to include the `stdio.h` library in our C program.

````C
#include<stdio.h>
````

Then, we can use the `tmpfile()` function to create a temporary file and assign it to a `FILE` pointer.

````C
FILE *temp_file = tmpfile();
````

We can then use this `FILE` pointer to access and manipulate the temporary file. For example, we can write data to the file using the `fwrite()` function.

````C
char data[100] = "This is a temporary file.";
fwrite(data, sizeof(char), 100, temp_file);
````

Once we are done using the temporary file, we can close it using the `fclose()` function. This will automatically delete the file from the temporary directory.

````C
fclose(temp_file);
````

## Deep Dive

Behind the scenes, the `tmpfile()` function creates a unique file name by appending a random string of characters to the end of a template string. This template string can be accessed using the `P_tmpdir` macro.

Using this approach, the possibility of accidentally overwriting an existing file or conflict with other processes is minimized. Additionally, the temporary file is not visible to the user, making it more secure.

It is worth noting that the temporary file is not persisted on the disk, meaning it will be automatically deleted when the program terminates. This makes it an ideal way to store sensitive data that should not be stored permanently.
