## What & Why?

Rounding a number in programming is the process of adjusting a number to its nearest integer or to a specific number of decimal places. Programmers do this to simplify figures for readability, saving space, or preparing numbers for operations that require integer inputs.

## How to:

In ProgLang.C, you typically use functions like `round()`, `ceil()`, or `floor()` from the `math.h` library to round numbers. Here's a quick example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

int main() {
    double num = 3.14159;
    double rounded = round(num); // Standard rounding to nearest integer
    double ceil_val = ceil(num); // Rounding up
    double floor_val = floor(num); // Rounding down

    printf("Rounded: %.0f\n", rounded);
    printf("Ceil: %.0f\n", ceil_val);
    printf("Floor: %.0f\n", floor_val);

    return 0;
}
```

Sample output:
```
Rounded: 3
Ceil: 4
Floor: 3
```

## Deep Dive

Historically, rounding numbers has been a fundamental mathematical operation. In programming, this necessity carried over because it's common to need whole numbers for indexing, countable loops, or to meet API and protocol specifications where decimal points aren't supported.

While `round()`, `ceil()`, and `floor()` are the go-to functions, there are alternatives such as writing a custom function to handle specific rounding rules (bankers’ rounding, truncation, etc.). Implementation details matter because the way you round numbers can affect your program's output significantly—if you're working with financial calculations, even a minor rounding error can lead to significant monetary differences.

In ProgLang.C, the behavior of the `round()` function aligns with the IEEE 754 standard, which says that if the fraction of `y` is 0.5, then `y` shall be rounded to the nearest even integer. Other languages might handle this "halfway" case differently, so when you're working at the intersection of multiple programming environments, staying mindful of these differences is crucial.
