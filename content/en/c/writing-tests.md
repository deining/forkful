## Why

Writing tests for C code is an important aspect of software development that helps ensure code quality and reduce the chances of bugs and errors. By writing tests, developers can catch and fix issues early on, saving time and effort in the long run.

## How To

To get started with writing tests in C, it is important to first understand the basic structure of a test. A test generally consists of three main parts: setting up the environment, executing the code to be tested, and verifying the expected output.

To demonstrate this, let's consider a simple function that adds two numbers and return the result:

```C
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

To test this function, we can create a test case using the `assert` macro from the `<assert.h>` library. This macro takes in a condition and returns an error if the condition is false.

```C
#include <assert.h>

int main() {
    // Setup
    int a = 5;
    int b = 10;

    // Execute
    int result = add(a, b);

    // Verify
    assert(result == 15);

    return 0;
}
```

After compiling and running this test, if all goes well, we should see an output of `OK` indicating that the test was successful.

## Deep Dive

Writing tests in C can be a bit more challenging compared to other languages due to its low-level nature. This means the developer has to manually manage memory and handle potential errors to ensure the code behaves as expected.

Fortunately, there are libraries such as `libcheck` that provide useful testing functions and macros to make writing tests in C easier. These libraries also offer more advanced features such as test grouping and parameterized testing.

Another important aspect to consider when writing tests is code coverage. Code coverage measures the percentage of code that is covered by tests. It is important to aim for high code coverage to ensure that all possible scenarios are tested.
