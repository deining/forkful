## What & Why?
Starting a new project is just another way of saying that a programmer is creating a new piece of software. This could be a mobile app, a website, or a computer program. Programmers start new projects to solve a problem, create something useful, or simply to exercise their coding skills. It's like a blank canvas waiting to be filled with code.

## How to:
To start a new project in C, follow these steps:
```C
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello World!");
    return 0;
}
```
Output: Hello World!

This simple program uses the standard library function `printf()` to display the words "Hello World!" on the screen. The `int` before `main()` indicates that the function returns an integer value, and the `return 0` statement ends the program. This is the basic structure of a C program.

## Deep Dive:
C was developed in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs. It is a high-level programming language known for its efficiency and portability. Starting a new project in C allows you to have complete control over your code, as it is a low-level language that gives you access to system resources and memory management.

An alternative to starting a new project in C is to use a higher-level language such as Java or Python. These languages offer more built-in features and are easier to learn, but they may not offer the same level of control as C.

When starting a new project in C, it is important to plan out your code and decide on a proper file structure. Organizing your code into separate files can make it easier to maintain and make changes in the future.
