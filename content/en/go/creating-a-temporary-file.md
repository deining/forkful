## Why

Creating temporary files is often necessary when working with computer programs, as they provide a way to temporarily store data that is needed to complete a task. In Go programming, temporary files can be used for a variety of purposes, such as storing downloaded data or caching information for faster retrieval. Understanding how to create and utilize temporary files can greatly improve the efficiency and functionality of your Go programs.

## How To 

Creating a temporary file in Go is relatively straightforward. We first need to import the `io/ioutil` package, which provides functions for working with files. Then, we can use the `ioutil.TempFile()` function to create a temporary file in the default temporary directory on our system. This function takes two parameters: the first is the directory path where the temporary file will be created (usually just an empty string), and the second is a prefix for the file name, which can be used to differentiate it from other temporary files. 

```Go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "io/ioutil"
)

func main() {
    // Create a temporary file
    tmpFile, err := ioutil.TempFile("", "example")
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println(err)
    }
    // Close the file when we are done
    defer tmpFile.Close()
	
    // Get the file path
    fmt.Println("Temporary file path: ", tmpFile.Name())

    // Write data to the temporary file
    fileData := "This is a temporary file created in Go!"
    _, err = tmpFile.Write([]byte(fileData))
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println(err)
    }
    
    // Read the data from the temporary file
    data, err := ioutil.ReadFile(tmpFile.Name())
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println(err)
    }
    
    // Print the data to the console
    fmt.Println("Data from temporary file: ", string(data))
}
```

The above code will create a temporary file with a name similar to `example662345742.txt` and will write the "This is a temporary file created in Go!" string to it. Then, it will read the data from the temporary file and print it to the console. 

## Deep Dive 

Under the hood, the `ioutil.TempFile()` function uses the `os.MkdirAll()` function to create a temporary directory, and then creates a file within that directory using the `os.OpenFile()` function. It also uses the `os.Remove()` function to clean up the temporary file once it is no longer needed. 

It is important to note that temporary files should not be relied upon for long-term storage as they can be removed by the operating system at any time. It is best to use them for short-term storage or data processing. Also, it is good practice to always close the temporary file once it is no longer needed to free up system resources.
