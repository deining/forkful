## What & Why?

Reading a text file is the process of accessing and extracting data stored in a file that is made up of plain text. Programmers commonly do this in order to retrieve important information, such as user data, from a file. 

## How to:

In Go, reading a text file involves using the `ioutil` package's `ReadFile()` function. First, we need to import the `ioutil` package into our code. Next, we can use the `ReadFile()` function to read a text file and store its contents into a variable. Below is an example code that reads a text file named "data.txt" and prints its contents to the standard output:

```Go
import (
  "fmt"
  "io/ioutil"
)

func main() {
  data, err := ioutil.ReadFile("data.txt")
  if err != nil {
    fmt.Println(err)
  }
  fmt.Println(string(data))
}
```

The output of this code will be the contents of "data.txt", as shown below:

```
This is the data stored in the text file.
```

## Deep Dive:

Historically, reading a text file was a much more complicated process as each programming language had its own unique way of accessing and extracting data from a file. However, with the advancements in modern programming languages, reading a text file has become a standardized and simplified process. 

An alternative to using the `ioutil.ReadFile()` function is to use the `os.Open()` function in combination with the `bufio` package's `NewScanner()` function, which provides more functionality for reading and manipulating data from a text file.

The implementation details of reading a text file primarily involve handling any errors that may occur, such as the file not being found or not having the correct permissions. It is important to properly handle these errors to ensure that the program can continue running smoothly.
