## Why
If you're a beginner in Go programming, one of the fundamental concepts you'll need to learn is how to read a text file. This skill is essential for any kind of data processing and manipulation, making it a crucial aspect of software development.

## How To
Reading a text file in Go is a straightforward process. First, we need to import the "os" and "io/ioutil" packages to have access to the necessary functions. Then, using the "ioutil.ReadFile" function, we can read the contents of the text file and store it in a variable.

```Go
import (
    "fmt"
    "os"
    "io/ioutil"
)

func main() {
    data, err := ioutil.ReadFile("file.txt")
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error reading file:", err)
        return
    }
    fmt.Println(string(data))
}
```

In this example, we are reading a file named "file.txt" and storing its contents in the "data" variable. We are also using error handling to make sure our code doesn't break if there is an issue with the file.

## Deep Dive
While the code above is sufficient for basic text file reading, there are some additional functions and techniques that can be useful in certain situations. For example, the "ioutil.ReadFile" function reads the entire file into memory at once, which may not be suitable for large files. In that case, we can use the "os.Open" and "bufio.Scanner" functions to read the file line by line, reducing memory usage.

Another aspect to consider is the encoding of the text file. Go uses UTF-8 as the default encoding, but if you're working with files in a different encoding, you can use the "bufio.NewReader" function along with the "charset.NewReaderLabel" function to convert the file's encoding before reading it.
