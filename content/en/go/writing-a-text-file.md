## What & Why?
Writing a text file is the process of creating a plain text document that can be opened and read by any text editor. Programmers often write text files to store data or configuration information that can be easily accessed and modified. 

## How to:
To write a text file in Go, we first need to import the "io/ioutil" package, which allows us to read and write to files. Next, we use the "ioutil.WriteFile()" function to write our desired data to a text file. The function takes in three parameters: the file name, the data to be written, and the file permissions. Here's an example:

```Go
import "io/ioutil"

func main() {
    data := []byte("Hello, world!") // convert string to byte slice
    err := ioutil.WriteFile("myfile.txt", data, 0644) // 0644 represents file permissions
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
}
```

Running this code will create a file called "myfile.txt" in the same directory as our Go file, with the text "Hello, world!" written to it. 

## Deep Dive:
Writing text files has been a fundamental operation in programming since the early days of computing. However, with the rise of databases and other storage options, text files have become less prevalent. Nevertheless, being able to create and manipulate text files is a useful skill for programmers. 

An alternative to using the "ioutil.WriteFile()" function is the "os.OpenFile()" function, which allows for more control over the file operations. Additionally, using the "os.File" type gives us access to methods such as "WriteString()" and "Write()", making it easier to write string or byte data to a file.
