## Why
Creating temporary files is a common practice in programming, especially in languages like TypeScript. These files can be useful for storing data or performing certain operations temporarily, without cluttering up the main project files. It can also be useful in scenarios where you need to manipulate data in a file without permanently altering the original file.

## How To
To create a temporary file in TypeScript, we can use the built-in `fs` module. Here is a simple example of how to create a temporary file and write some data to it:

```TypeScript
import fs from 'fs';

// Create a temporary file
fs.mkdtemp('prefix-', (err, folder) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    
    // Write data to the file
    fs.writeFile(`${folder}/temp_file.txt`, 'This is a temporary file.', (err) => {
        if (err) throw err;
        console.log('File successfully created and data written.');
    });
});
```

Running this code will create a temporary folder with a randomly generated name, prefixed with 'prefix-'. Within that folder, a file named `temp_file.txt` will be created with the text "This is a temporary file." written to it.

## Deep Dive
Creating a temporary file involves two main steps: creating the temporary folder and then creating the actual file within that folder. In the above example, we used the `mkdtemp()` method from the `fs` module to create a temporary folder. This method takes two parameters - a prefix for the folder name and a callback function that will receive an error (if any) and the path of the created folder. 

Once the folder is created, we then use the `writeFile()` method to create the temporary file within that folder. This method takes three parameters - the file name, the data to be written to the file, and a callback function to handle any errors.

Other methods that can be used to create temporary files in TypeScript include `mkstemp()` and `mktemp()`. It is important to note that temporary files are generally deleted automatically when the program terminates, but it is good practice to explicitly delete them using the `unlink()` method.
