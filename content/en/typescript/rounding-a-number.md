## What & Why?

Rounding a number is essentially about trimming it down to a certain level of precision, usually to a whole number or to a specific number of decimal places. Programmers round numbers to make them more human-friendly, to limit the detail of a figure where extreme precision isn't necessary, or to comply with specific business rules.

## How to:

Rounding up, rounding down, and rounding to the nearest whole number are common operations in TypeScript, just like any other language. Let's see how it's done.

```typescript
// Rounding to the nearest whole number
let originalNumber: number = 3.14159;
let roundedNumber: number = Math.round(originalNumber);
console.log(roundedNumber); // Output: 3

// Rounding up (ceiling)
let roundedUpNumber: number = Math.ceil(originalNumber);
console.log(roundedUpNumber); // Output: 4

// Rounding down (floor)
let roundedDownNumber: number = Math.floor(originalNumber);
console.log(roundedDownNumber); // Output: 3

// Rounding to a fixed number of decimal places
let fixedTwoDecimalPlaces: number = parseFloat(originalNumber.toFixed(2));
console.log(fixedTwoDecimalPlaces); // Output: 3.14
```

## Deep Dive

Rounding numbers has been part of mathematics for ages, and natural for programming languages to include. In TypeScript, rounding functions are inherited from JavaScript's `Math` object since TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript.

1. **toFixed() Method:** In TypeScript, when rounding to a specific number of decimal places, the `.toFixed()` method is handy but returns a string. Hence, the use of `parseFloat()` to convert it back to a number, if necessary for further numerical operations.

2. **Precision and Performance:** While these methods are straightforward, there are considerations for performance and accuracy, especially with floating-point math where round-off errors can occur. For financial applications, for instance, where precision is crucial, one might need to use libraries designed to handle currency and precision arithmetic.

3. **Alternatives:** Libraries like BigNumber.js, Decimal.js, or built-in functions in financial or scientific libraries may be considered to manage complex rounding requirements and precision-related issues.

Historically, different rounding strategies can have significant effects, such as in allocation of resources and financial computationsâ€”well-documented in places like banking system histories.
