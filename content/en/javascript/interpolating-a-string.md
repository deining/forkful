## What & Why?

Interpolating a string in Javascript refers to the process of dynamically inserting values into a string at runtime. This allows programmers to create dynamic, customizable strings by incorporating variables or other string values into their code. It is a useful technique for creating user-friendly output and reducing code duplication.

## How to:

To interpolate a string in Javascript, you can use the template literals syntax introduced in ES6. This involves using backticks (`) instead of single or double quotes and adding placeholders ${variable} inside the string where you want to insert values. For example:

```Javascript
let name = "John";
let age = 25;
let message = `Hello, my name is ${name} and I am ${age} years old.`;
console.log(message);
```

This will output: `Hello, my name is John and I am 25 years old.`

You can also use more complex expressions within the placeholders, such as calculations or function calls. For example:

```Javascript
let a = 5;
let b = 10;
let message = `The result of ${(a+b)*2} is twice the sum of ${a} and ${b}.`
console.log(message);
```

This will output: `The result of 30 is twice the sum of 5 and 10.`

## Deep Dive:

The concept of interpolating strings has been around for a long time, with various implementations in different programming languages. In Javascript, it was first introduced in ES6 as part of the template literals syntax. Before that, programmers had to use string concatenation or formatting functions to achieve a similar result.

Some alternative methods to interpolate strings in Javascript include using string concatenation with the + operator or string formatting methods like `String.format()`. However, these methods can be more cumbersome and less readable than template literals.

When using template literals, the expressions within the placeholders are evaluated at runtime, allowing for dynamic and customizable output. However, this also means you should be careful when including user-input variables to avoid potential security risks.
