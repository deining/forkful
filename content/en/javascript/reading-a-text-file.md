## Why

Have you ever needed to read and extract information from a text file in your JavaScript programming projects? Text files are a common data format for storing and sharing information, so knowing how to read them can be a valuable skill for any programmer.

## How To

Reading a text file in JavaScript is a relatively straightforward task. First, we need to declare a new `FileReader` object and specify the path of the file we want to read:

```Javascript
let fileReader = new FileReader();
fileReader.readAsText("/myTextFile.txt");
```

Next, we need to define a function to handle the file reading process. This function will be triggered once the file has been successfully read and will receive the read data as a parameter:

```Javascript
fileReader.onload = function(event) {
  let fileContent = event.target.result;
  console.log(fileContent);
}
```

Finally, we can call the `readAsText()` method to start the file reading process and access the file's content within the `onload` function:

```Javascript
fileReader.readAsText("/myTextFile.txt");
```

## Deep Dive

The `FileReader` object provides multiple methods for reading different types of files, such as `readAsBinaryString()`, `readAsArrayBuffer()`, and `readAsDataURL()`. Depending on the type of data in your text file, you may need to use a different method to read it correctly.

Additionally, it's important to note that the `readAsText()` method uses the default character encoding of the system the JavaScript code is running on. This could lead to unexpected results if the text file has been encoded using a different character set. To avoid this, we can specify the character encoding in the `readAsText()` method as a second parameter:

```Javascript
fileReader.readAsText("/myTextFile.txt", "UTF-8");
```
