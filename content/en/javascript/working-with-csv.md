## Why

In today's technology-driven world, the demand for data analysis and manipulation is ever-increasing. One way to handle large sets of data is through Comma-Separated Values (CSV) files. These files contain tabular data, making it easier to organize and analyze data. Learning how to work with CSVs can be a valuable skill for any programmer or data analyst.

## How To

Working with CSVs in Javascript is a straightforward process. Let's take a look at a sample code that reads data from a CSV file and prints it to the console.

```Javascript
const fs = require('fs'); //importing the file system module
const parse = require('csv-parse'); //importing the csv-parse module

fs.readFile('data.csv', 'utf8', (err, data) => { //reading the CSV file
  if (err) {
    return console.error(err); //handling error if file cannot be read
  }
  parse(data, {}, (err, output) => { //parsing the data into an array
    if (err) {
      return console.error(err); //handling error if data cannot be parsed
    }
    console.log(output); //printing the array to the console
  })
});
```

The first step is to import the necessary modules, in this case, the file system and csv-parse modules. Then, we use the `readFile` function to read the CSV file and pass in the name of the file and the encoding type. Next, we use the `parse` function to convert the data into an array, and finally, we print the output to the console.

The CSV data is now stored in the `output` variable, and we can use it to manipulate and analyze the data further.

## Deep Dive

While working with CSVs in Javascript may seem simple, there are a few things to keep in mind. Firstly, the data in a CSV file is separated by a delimiter, which is usually a comma. However, it is essential to check the delimiter used in the file you are working with. Secondly, CSV files may contain quoted data, which means some values may be enclosed in double-quotes. This can cause issues while parsing the data, and it is important to take this into consideration while writing the code.

Additionally, it is good practice to handle errors while reading and parsing the data, as shown in the code example above. This ensures that your code can handle any unexpected issues with the CSV file.
