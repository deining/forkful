## What & Why?

Starting a new project in Javascript means creating a new program or application using the Javascript programming language. Programmers start new projects to build solutions for various problems or to create new products that meet certain user needs.

## How to:

To start a new project in Javascript, you first need to create a new file with a .js extension. This file will contain the code for your project. Here's an example of a simple "Hello World" program in Javascript:

```Javascript
console.log("Hello World");
```

Running this code will output "Hello World" to the console. You can run your Javascript code using the Node.js runtime or by embedding it in an HTML file and opening it in a browser.

## Deep Dive:

Javascript was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich and was originally designed to be a scripting language for web browsers. However, with the advancements in Javascript and the introduction of the Node.js runtime, it is now used for building applications for both the client and server-side.

Some alternatives to starting a new project in Javascript include using other programming languages like Python or Java, or using frameworks such as React or Angular. However, Javascript's simplicity and flexibility make it a popular choice for many developers.

When starting a new project, it is important to plan and organize your code structure beforehand to ensure efficiency and maintainability. This can include creating separate files for different functionalities, using coding standards, and adopting best practices.
