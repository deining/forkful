## What & Why?

Rounding a number in JavaScript is the process of adjusting a floating-point number to a nearby whole number. Programmers do this to simplify numbers, especially when dealing with currency or precision that doesn't need to go beyond a decimal point.

## How to:

```ProgLang.JAVASCRIPT
// Rounding to the nearest whole number
console.log(Math.round(3.6)); // Outputs: 4

// Rounding down
console.log(Math.floor(3.6)); // Outputs: 3

// Rounding up
console.log(Math.ceil(3.2)); // Outputs: 4

// Fixing to a certain number of decimal places
console.log((2.34567).toFixed(2)); // Outputs: "2.35" as a string
```

## Deep Dive

Rounding numbers is a fundamental aspect of many programming tasks, and it goes back to the early days of computing where every byte of data was precious, especially for programmers working with limited hardware resources. 

Historically, programming languages have provided various ways to round numbers, reflecting different needs for precision and performance. In JavaScript, rounding functions are part of the built-in `Math` object that offers several methods to perform different kinds of rounding:

- `Math.round()` rounds to the nearest whole number, following standard mathematical rules (up on 0.5 and above).
- `Math.floor()` always rounds down to the nearest whole number, while `Math.ceil()` always rounds up.
- To fix the number of decimal points, `.toFixed()` method converts a number into a string, rounding to a specified number of decimal places.

It's also good to know that JavaScript uses floating-point arithmetic, which can lead to precision errors especially in binary floating-point like IEEE 754, which is what JavaScript uses. That means sometimes rounding can give unexpected results due to how numbers are stored in memory.

Alternatives to the built-in methods for rounding can involve custom functions, especially where more control is needed over the rounding process. Libraries like BigNumber.js or Decimal.js can be used to handle precise decimal calculations and rounding, without the quirks of binary floating-point arithmetic.

Regarding implementation, keep in mind potential edge cases and remember that since `.toFixed()` returns a string, if you need to further calculate with the returned number, you'll need to convert it back to a Number type using `parseFloat()` or the unary plus operator `(+)`.
