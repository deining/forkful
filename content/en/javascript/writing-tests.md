## Why
As a programmer, testing may seem like a daunting and time-consuming task. However, writing tests for your code is crucial for ensuring its functionality and catching any potential bugs. Testing not only helps you to identify errors early on, but it also improves the overall quality and reliability of your code. 

## How To
To get started with writing tests in Javascript, you will need to use a testing framework. Jest is a popular choice for testing in Javascript, as it is easy to set up and has a user-friendly interface. Here's an example of how to write a test using Jest:

```Javascript
// Example function to be tested
function sum(a, b) {
   return a + b;
}

// Test case using Jest
test('adds 1 + 2 to equal 3', () => {
   expect(sum(1, 2)).toBe(3);
});
```

In this example, we have created a basic function that adds two numbers together and then written a test case to check if it returns the correct result. The `expect` statement is used to define the expected output, and the `toBe` statement compares it to the actual output of the function. 

Jest also provides a range of other useful methods for testing, such as `toEqual` for checking the value of objects and arrays, `not` for negating a statement, and `toThrow` for testing if a function throws an error. You can find more information and examples on how to use Jest in their documentation.

## Deep Dive
When writing tests, it is important to cover all edge cases and error scenarios, not just the basic functionality. You can do this by writing multiple test cases that cover different input combinations and expected outputs. This ensures that your code is robust and can handle unexpected situations. 

Another essential aspect of writing tests is maintaining them as your codebase evolves. As you make changes to your code, you must also update your tests to match these changes. This ensures that your tests continue to reflect the current functionality of your code and catch any new errors that may arise. 

Lastly, remember that testing is not a one-time task. Continuously testing your code, both manually and automatically, helps to identify and fix bugs early on in the development process, making it smoother and more efficient.
