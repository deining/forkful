## What & Why?

Rounding a number is pretty much what it sounds like; it's adjusting the number to the nearest whole number or to a specified decimal place for simplicity or clarity. Programmers round numbers for reasons ranging from displaying user-friendly data to meeting mathematical calculation requirements where precision is unnecessary or could actually throw off the results.

## How to:

Rounding numbers in PHP is straightforward with a few built-in functions. Here's a quick look at how to use them:

```php
<?php
// Round to the nearest whole number
echo round(3.14159); // Outputs: 3

// Round to one decimal place
echo round(3.14159, 1); // Outputs: 3.1

// Always round up
echo ceil(3.14159); // Outputs: 4

// Always round down
echo floor(3.14159); // Outputs: 3
?>
```

Each function has its purpose, and the output showcases the result of each method.

## Deep Dive

Historically, the rounding of numbers is as old as mathematics itself, used for simplification in ancient trade and various applications since. In PHP, rounding functions have been available for quite some time, and considering PHP's broad usage for web development, these functions are fundamental for handling everything from financial transactions to user display formatting.

Beyond the basics, PHP offers a `number_format()` function for formatting numbers with rounded precision and added commas, which is particularly useful for currency display.

```php
<?php
// Format number with rounded precision and added commas
echo number_format(123456.789, 2); // Outputs: 123,456.79
?>
```

It's also worth noting the `round()` function can take a mode parameter for more control, such as `PHP_ROUND_HALF_UP` or `PHP_ROUND_HALF_DOWN`, which determine how to round values that are exactly halfway between two integers.

As for alternatives within PHP, apart from the main rounding functions (`round()`, `ceil()`, `floor()`), conditionals or mathematical operations could theoretically be used to achieve similar results but are usually not necessary given the functionality already provided.
