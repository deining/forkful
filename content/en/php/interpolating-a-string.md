## What & Why?

Interpolating a string in PHP refers to the process of inserting variable values or expressions into a string. This allows the string to dynamically change based on the values of the variables, making it more versatile and adaptable. Programmers use string interpolation to create dynamic and customizable text, whether it be for generating error messages, creating user prompts, or constructing complex SQL queries.

## How to:

To interpolate a string in PHP, simply use double quotes around the string and insert the variable or expression inside the string using curly braces. Here's an example:

```PHP
$name = "John";
echo "Hello {$name}!"; // Output: Hello John! 
```

You can also use concatenation with the "." operator to achieve the same result:

```PHP
$name = "John";
echo "Hello " . $name . "!"; // Output: Hello John!
```

However, using string interpolation makes the code cleaner and easier to read, especially when dealing with multiple variables in a string. You can also use string interpolation with arrays and objects, making it a powerful tool for creating dynamic text.

## Deep Dive

Historically, PHP used the concatenation method with the "." operator to insert variables into strings. However, this could make the code cluttered and difficult to maintain, especially in longer strings. This led to the introduction of string interpolation in PHP 5. This feature has become widely used and is now a standard practice in the PHP community.

While string interpolation is a popular way of inserting variables into strings, there are other alternatives such as using the sprintf() function or using single quotes and concatenation. These methods may be more suitable for certain scenarios and it's always good to have different options.

In terms of implementation, string interpolation is achieved by parsing the string and finding any expressions or variables within curly braces. Then, the values of these expressions or variables are substituted into the string before it is outputted. This process makes the code more efficient and allows for quick and easy customization of texts.
