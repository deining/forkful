## Why Generate Random Numbers?

Generating random numbers is a crucial part of many computer programs and applications. Whether it's for creating randomized game elements, generating secure passwords, or conducting scientific simulations, having the ability to generate random numbers is essential. In this blog post, we will explore the basics of generating random numbers in C# and how to use it in your code.

## How To Generate Random Numbers in C#

C# has a built-in class called "Random" that allows us to generate random numbers. To begin, we must first instantiate a Random object and then call its "Next" method. Let's take a look at an example:

```C#
Random random = new Random(); //instantiates a Random object
int randomNumber = random.Next(1, 101); //generates a random number between 1 and 100
Console.WriteLine(randomNumber); //outputs the generated random number
```

The code above will generate a random integer between 1 and 100 and print it to the console. Keep in mind that the "Next" method takes in two parameters, the first being the minimum value (inclusive) and the second being the maximum value (exclusive). This means that the range of generated numbers will start at the minimum value and end at the maximum value - 1.

## Deep Dive into Generating Random Numbers

The Random class in C# uses a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) algorithm to generate numbers. This algorithm uses a seed value to produce a sequence of seemingly random numbers. The seed value can be supplied by the programmer or it can be left to the system to generate a seed using the current time.

It's important to note that the sequence of numbers generated by a PRNG is not truly random and can be predicted or repeated. However, for most applications, this level of randomness is sufficient. If you need true random numbers, then you can use external sources such as hardware devices that generate random numbers.
