## What & Why?

Writing tests in programming is the process of creating automated scripts that check if the code written by a programmer is functioning as expected. Programmers write tests to ensure the quality and accuracy of their code, identify and fix any errors, and prevent future bugs from occurring. 

## How to:

Writing tests in PowerShell is relatively simple and efficient. The code below shows an example of writing a test for a calculator function that adds two numbers and verifies the expected result is returned.

```PowerShell
Function Add-Calculator {
    Param (
        [int]$FirstNumber,
        [int]$SecondNumber
    )

    return $FirstNumber + $SecondNumber
}

Describe "Add-Calculator" {
    It "Correctly adds two numbers" {
        $result = Add-Calculator -FirstNumber 2 -SecondNumber 3
        $expectedResult = 5

        $result | Should -Be $expectedResult
    }
}
```
The output of this script will state that the test passed, indicating that the `Add-Calculator` function is working as expected. 

## Deep Dive:

Writing tests has been around since the early days of software development. In the past, tests were written manually and were often time consuming and prone to human error. However, with the rise of automated testing tools and frameworks, writing tests has become an integral part of the development process. 

There are various alternatives to writing tests in PowerShell. Some popular tools include Pester, PSScriptAnalyzer, and PSRule. These tools offer different features and capabilities, but ultimately serve the same purpose of improving the quality of code.

When writing tests in PowerShell, it's important to follow best practices to ensure effective and efficient testing. This includes writing descriptive and concise test names, organizing tests into descriptive blocks, and using helpful output formats. Additionally, tests should be designed to run independently of one another to avoid failures impacting other tests.
