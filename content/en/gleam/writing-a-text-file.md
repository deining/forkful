# Writing Text Files in Gleam: A How-To Guide

## What & Why?
Writing a text file refers to the process of creating a file that contains only text-based data. Programmers use this technique to store information that can be easily read and edited by both humans and machines. It allows for the flexibility of adding and updating data without the need for specialized software.

## How to:
Writing a text file in Gleam is a simple process that can be done using the standard library's `File` module. Below is a basic example of creating and writing data to a text file:

```Gleam
import gleam/file

fn main() {
  // Create a new file named "example.txt"
  let file = file.create("example.txt");

  // Write data to the file
  file.write("Hello, world!");

  // Close the file when finished
  file.close()
}
```

The output of this code will be a new text file called "example.txt" with the text "Hello, world!" written in it. Gleam also offers functions for appending, reading, and manipulating the data in a text file.

## Deep Dive:
Text files have been a fundamental part of programming since its early days. They are a versatile and widely used method for storing data in a human-readable format. In Gleam, there are alternative methods for storing and manipulating data, such as using databases or other data structures within the language.

When writing a text file in Gleam, it's important to note that the data is written to the file in its raw form. This means that any formatting, such as line breaks or indentation, must be added explicitly. It's also worth mentioning that Gleam's standard library offers various functions for handling errors and ensuring that the file is properly closed after use.
