## What & Why?

Creating temporary files is a common practice in programming where a temporary file is created and used for storing data temporarily during the execution of a program. One of the main reasons for creating temporary files is to efficiently manage memory usage by freeing up space when it is no longer needed.

## How to:

In Gleam, creating a temporary file is a simple process. First, we need to import the ```std/file/temporary``` module. Then, we can use the ```create``` function to create a temporary file. Here's an example of how this would look in code:

```Gleam
import std/file/temporary

let tmp_file = temporary.create()

```

This will create a temporary file and assign it to the ```tmp_file``` variable. We can then use this file to store any data we need. Once the program is finished running, the temporary file will be automatically deleted.

## Deep Dive

Creating temporary files has been a common practice for a long time, dating back to the early days of computing. It was originally used to store data that couldn't fit into the limited memory of early computers. However, even with the advancement of technology, the use of temporary files remains relevant for managing memory efficiently.

There are alternatives to using temporary files, such as storing data in memory or using a database. However, temporary files are a simple and efficient solution that is still widely used.

In Gleam, the ```temporary.create()``` function uses the operating system's native temporary file functionality, making it platform-independent and reliable. The files created are unique and will not clash with existing files, ensuring the safety and security of our data.

If you would like to learn more about creating temporary files in Gleam, you can refer to the official documentation on the ```std/file/temporary``` module. Additionally, you can explore other file-related modules in the Gleam standard library, such as ```std/file``` and ```std/file/system```. Happy coding!
