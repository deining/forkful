# Converting a Date into a String in Gleam

## What & Why?

Converting a date into a string means translating a date - which is in a formatted digital representation - into a printable string format. This is particularly useful for displaying dates in a human-readable form. Programmers often convert dates to strings to show them on user interfaces or to store them in databases.

## How to:

The process of converting a date into a string is simple in Gleam. The `Time` module provides functions for converting dates into strings, as shown in the following code examples:

```Gleam
import Time

// Convert a date into an ISO 8601 string format
Time.Date.to_iso8601_string(2021, 10, 25) // Outputs: "2021-10-25"

// Convert a date into a custom string format
Time.Date.to_string(2021, 10, 25, "%B %d, %Y") // Outputs: "October 25, 2021"
```

As you can see, the `to_iso8601_string` function converts the date into a standardized format, while the `to_string` function allows for a variety of custom formats.

## Deep Dive

### Historical Context

Converting dates to strings has been an essential task in the programming world since the early days of computing. It was particularly challenging on older systems due to their limited character sets and variable ways of representing dates. However, with the introduction of standardized date formats, such as ISO 8601, this task has become much more streamlined and uniform.

### Alternatives

In Gleam, there are a few alternative ways to represent dates, such as using integers or tuples. However, these formats are less versatile and may require more code to manipulate and display the date. Therefore, converting dates into strings remains the preferred method for displaying dates in a human-readable format.

### Implementation Details

Under the hood, Gleam's `Time` module uses Erlang's `calendar` module to perform date calculations and formatting. This module provides robust and efficient functions for handling dates and times, making it a suitable choice for these operations in Gleam.
