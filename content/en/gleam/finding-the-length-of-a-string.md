## Why?

The length of a string is a fundamental concept in programming and is required for a variety of tasks such as input validation, data manipulation, and error handling. Understanding how to find the length of a string is an essential skill for any programmer.

## How To

Finding the length of a string in Gleam is a simple process that can be achieved using the built-in `String.length` function. Let's take a look at an example:

```Gleam
import gleam/string

let name = "John"

let len = String.length(name)

debug!{"The length of the string is {len}"} // Output: The length of the string is 4
```

In this example, we first import the `string` module from the Gleam standard library. Then, we create a string variable named `name` and assign it a value of "John". Next, we use the `String.length` function to find the length of the string and store it in a variable called `len`. Finally, we use the `debug!` function to print out the length of the string to the console.

## Deep Dive

Behind the scenes, the `String.length` function uses the code unit count to determine the length of a string. A code unit is an element within a string that represents a single character. In languages like Gleam, each code unit is typically represented by one Unicode code point, which is a unique number assigned to each character in the Unicode standard.

It's important to note that the length of a string can differ from the number of characters it contains, as some characters may require more than one code unit. For example, the character "Ã©" requires two code units to represent it in Unicode.
