# What & Why?
Starting a new project in programming means creating something new using code. It can be a web app, a mobile app, a game, or anything else you can think of. Programmers start new projects for various reasons, such as building a new and innovative product, learning a new language or technology, or simply for fun.

# How to:
To start a new project in Gleam, follow these simple steps:

1. Create a new directory for your project: ```mkdir my_project```
2. Navigate to the project directory: ```cd my_project```
3. Initialize a new Gleam project: ```gleam init```
4. This will generate some boilerplate code to get you started, including a ```src``` folder for your source code and a ```tests``` folder for your tests.
5. Open the ```src/main.gleam``` file and start coding your project.
6. Once you are done, run ```gleam build``` to compile your project.
7. You can then run your project by typing ```gleam run```.
8. That's it! You have successfully started a new project in Gleam.

# Deep Dive
Gleam is a relatively new programming language, created in 2020 by Louis Pilfold and other contributors. It is a compiled, statically-typed language that runs on the Erlang Virtual Machine, making it highly performant and fault-tolerant. Starting a new project in Gleam gives you access to its powerful type system, excellent tooling, and functional programming paradigm.

If you are familiar with other languages like Rust, Elm, or Haskell, you will find some similarities in Gleam's syntax and features. However, Gleam has its unique features, including lightweight processes, pattern matching, and automatic memory management.

In the past, starting a new project in a functional language was not as simple as it is now. With Gleam, you no longer need to worry about complicated setup processes or dependency management. The language's tooling takes care of all that for you, so you can focus on writing code and building your project.
