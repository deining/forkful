## What & Why?

Reading text files is a common task for programmers. It involves reading text data from a file, which can then be processed or manipulated within a program. Programmers often need to read text files to access large amounts of data, such as log files or configuration files, for their applications.

## How to:

Reading a text file in Gleam is straightforward. First, we need to import the standard library module `gleam/io` which provides functions for working with files. Then, we can use the `read_file` function to read the contents of a file and store it in a string variable. Let's see an example:

```Gleam
import gleam/io

let file_contents = read_file("my_file.txt")

_ = println(file_contents)
```

Running this code will print the contents of the file `my_file.txt` to the console. We can also specify an encoding while reading the file, for example, `read_file("my_file.txt", "UTF-8")`.

## Deep Dive

Reading text files has been a fundamental task for programmers since the early days of computing. In the past, the process was more complex as different operating systems had their own file formats and encodings. However, with the advent of standardized encoding formats like ASCII and UTF-8, reading text files has become much simpler and more consistent across different systems.

There are alternatives to reading text files, such as using databases or storing data in specialized formats. However, reading from text files is still a common approach, especially for simpler projects or when working with legacy systems.

When reading a text file, it is important to consider the encoding in which the file was saved. This can affect the accuracy of the data and how it is interpreted by the program. Gleam's `read_file` function allows for specifying the encoding to ensure that the data is correctly read.
