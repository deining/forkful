## Why

In today's digital age, HTML is the backbone of the internet. It is used to create websites and web applications, making it an essential language for developers. As a result, understanding how to parse HTML is a valuable skill for anyone looking to work with web technologies.

## How To

HTML is essentially a structured text document, which is why it is relatively easy to parse. In this section, we will cover the basic steps needed to parse HTML using C++.

To begin, we will use the **HTML Parser library**, a popular open-source C++ library for parsing HTML. First, we need to include the necessary header files:

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <htmlparser/htmlparser.h>
```

Next, we will create an HTML parser object and load the HTML document we want to parse:

```C++
HTMLParser parser;
parser.parseFile("index.html");
```

Now, we can access the parsed HTML document using the `root` object, which is of type `HTMLTreeNode`. We can then traverse through the document structure using methods like `getChildren()` and `getAttributeValue()`.

To demonstrate, let's say we want to retrieve the value of the `id` attribute from a `<div>` tag with `class="container"`:

```C++
HTMLTreeNode* divNode = root->getChild(0)->getChild(0);
std::string idValue = divNode->getAttributeValue("id");
```

We can also extract the tag's content by using the `getText()` method:

```C++
std::string content = divNode->getText();
```

## Deep Dive

While the basic steps outlined above are enough for simple HTML parsing, the HTML Parser library offers many more powerful features. For instance, it supports CSS selectors, allowing you to extract specific elements from the HTML document easily.

Additionally, the library also provides methods for handling malformed or invalid HTML, making it a reliable tool for parsing even poorly written HTML code. It also offers options for optimizing performance, such as enabling or disabling automatic tag balancing and tag closing.

Overall, the HTML Parser library is a comprehensive tool for parsing HTML in C++, providing developers with an efficient and flexible way to work with web technologies.
