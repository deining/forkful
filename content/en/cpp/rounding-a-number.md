## What & Why?
Rounding a number is the process of adjusting it to a nearby value to simplify it, typically to remove unnecessary precision. Programmers round numbers for a host of reasons—to meet specific numeric formats, to prepare human-friendly output, or to speed up computations by reducing the level of precision.

## How to:
Rounding numbers in C++ is straightforward with the help of the standard library. Here are a few functions you can use:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath> // for std::round, std::ceil, std::floor

int main() {
    double original = 7.6;

    // Standard rounding to nearest whole number
    double rounded = std::round(original);
    std::cout << "Rounded: " << rounded << '\n'; // Rounded: 8

    // Rounding up
    double roundedUp = std::ceil(original);
    std::cout << "Rounded Up: " << roundedUp << '\n'; // Rounded Up: 8

    // Rounding down
    double roundedDown = std::floor(original);
    std::cout << "Rounded Down: " << roundedDown << '\n'; // Rounded Down: 7

    return 0;
}
```
When you run this code, it outputs the rounded, rounded-up, and rounded-down versions of the `original` number.

## Deep Dive
The concept of rounding numbers has been around for centuries, if not millennia, as people have always sought ways to simplify calculations. In programming, rounding is not only about simplicity but also about precision and performance. Differences in how numbers are stored and calculated in computers mean that certain arithmetic operations can yield very long fractional parts, which are sometimes unnecessary.

There are several ways to round numbers, depending on the result you're looking for:

- `std::round` brings a number to the nearest integer. If the fractional part is .5 or more, it rounds up, otherwise it rounds down.
- `std::ceil` (short for "ceiling") always rounds up to the nearest integer.
- `std::floor` always rounds down to the nearest integer.

Each of these functions deals with floating-point numbers that do not always behave as expected due to their binary representation—a topic known as floating-point arithmetic.

Another alternative is truncation, which removes the fraction outright, always rounding down towards zero. While not technically rounding, `std::trunc` is useful when the direction towards zero is needed.

Finally, programmers must consider the type of rounding their application needs based on context, such as financial calculations where specific rounding rules may apply.
