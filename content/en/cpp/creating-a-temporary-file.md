## What & Why?

Creating a temporary file in programming refers to the process of generating a file that is used only temporarily to store data. Programmers often create temporary files to store intermediate data during their program execution, or to handle large amounts of data that cannot be easily stored in memory.

## How to:

Creating a temporary file in C++ is a simple process that involves using the standard library function ```tmpfile()```. This function creates a temporary file and returns a pointer to the file stream. The file is automatically deleted when the program terminates. See the example below:

```C++
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    FILE *fp = NULL;
    fp = tmpfile();
    if (fp == NULL) {
        printf("Failed to create temporary file.");
    }
    else {
        printf("Temporary file created successfully.");
    }
    return 0;
}
```
Output:
```
Temporary file created successfully.
```

## Deep Dive:

Creating temporary files dates back to the early days of computing when disk storage was limited and expensive. Temporary files were commonly used to store intermediate results of a program to increase efficiency. Now, with larger storage capacity, temporary files may not always be necessary, but are still used for a variety of reasons such as handling large data, sharing data between processes, and creating backups.

Alternatives to creating a temporary file in C++ include using in-memory data structures, such as arrays or linked lists, to store temporary data. However, this approach can be limiting for handling large amounts of data. Another alternative is using pipes or sockets to share data between processes, but this requires additional coding and may not be as efficient as using temporary files.

The implementation of creating a temporary file in C++ varies depending on the operating system. On Unix-based systems, the temporary file is created in the ```/tmp``` directory, while on Windows, it is created in the current directory. Additionally, the operation of the temporary file might differ between operating systems, such as the automatic deletion of the file or the maximum size of the file.
