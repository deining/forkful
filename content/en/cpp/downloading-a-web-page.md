## Why 

If you're a web developer, you know the importance of being able to access and analyze web page data. Downloading a web page allows you to gather information, analyze its structure, and perform various tests to improve its performance and user experience. 

## How To

To download a web page in C++, we first need to include the appropriate headers: 

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <curl/curl.h>
```

Next, we'll create a `main` function and initialize a CURL object. 

```C++
int main() {

    CURL *curl;
    curl = curl_easy_init();
```

Within the `main` function, we can specify the URL of the web page we want to download. 

```C++
    // Set the URL of the web page to be downloaded
    curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://www.example.com");

```

Then, we can specify the file path and name where the downloaded web page will be saved. 

```C++
    // Set the file path and name for the downloaded web page
    FILE *fp;
    fp = fopen("downloaded_page.html", "wb");
```

Now, we can start the download process by using the `curl_easy_perform` function. 

```C++
    // Perform the download and save the output to the specified file
    curl_easy_perform(curl);
    curl_easy_cleanup(curl);

    // Close the file 
    fclose(fp);

    return 0;
}
```

Once the program is executed, the web page will be downloaded and saved to the specified file path. We can then use the downloaded page for further analysis and testing. 

### Sample Output

The downloaded web page will be saved as an HTML file, which can be opened and viewed in any web browser. 

## Deep Dive

There are a few important things to note when downloading a web page in C++ using CURL. 

First, the `curl_easy_init` function is used to initialize a CURL object and the `curl_easy_cleanup` function is used to cleanup the object once the download is complete. 

Secondly, the `curl_easy_setopt` function is used to specify different options for the download, such as the URL and file path. You can also specify options for authentication, proxy, and other parameters. 

Lastly, the `curl_easy_perform` function is used to actually perform the download. It returns a `CURLE_OK` status if the download was successful.
