## What & Why?
Converting a date into a string is the process of converting a date object, containing information about a specific date and time, into a human-readable string format. This is a common practice among programmers, as it allows for easier storage and manipulation of date data in programs.

## How to:
The following code shows an example of how to convert a date into a string in C++:

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <ctime>

int main() {
    // Create a date object using current date and time
    std::time_t now = std::time(0);
    std::tm* timeinfo = std::localtime(&now);

    // Convert date object into string format
    std::string date_string = std::asctime(timeinfo);

    // Print out the date string
    std::cout << date_string << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

Sample Output:
```Sun Jul 25 13:02:15 2021```

## Deep Dive:
Converting dates into strings has been a common practice since the early days of programming. In the early days, dates were often stored as string literals in the code, making it difficult to manipulate and compare dates. As programming languages evolved, the ability to convert dates into string formats became more important. 

One alternative to converting dates into strings is to use date objects directly in code. However, this can become cumbersome and unreadable, especially when comparing and manipulating dates. Converting dates into strings allows for easier manipulation and comparison of dates, as well as easier storage in databases or files.

In terms of implementation, most programming languages have built-in functions or libraries that allow for easy conversion of date objects into string formats. In C++, the <ctime> library provides the necessary functions, such as ```std::asctime()```, to convert date objects into strings.
