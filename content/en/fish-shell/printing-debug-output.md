## Why
Debugging is an essential part of programming, and one of the most effective ways to identify and fix issues is by printing debug output. This allows you to see the values of variables, function calls, and other important information at different points in your code. In this blog post, we'll explore how to use the Fish Shell to print debug output in your programs.

## How To
To print debug output in the Fish Shell, we can use the `echo` command. This command will print whatever text or variables we pass into it. Let's take a look at an example:

```Fish Shell
set variable "Hello World"
echo $variable
```

The output of this code will be `Hello World`. This means that the value of the `variable` variable is being printed to the console. We can also use the `set -x` command to enable debug mode in the Fish Shell. This will print out every command that is executed in the shell, making it easier to trace the flow of your program.

```Fish Shell
set -x
set variable "Hello World"
set another_variable "Hola Mundo"
echo $variable
```

The output of this code will be:

```
set variable "Hello World"
set another_variable "Hola Mundo"
echo $variable
```

As you can see, the `set` and `echo` commands are being printed along with their corresponding parameters. This can be incredibly useful when debugging complex programs, as it allows you to see exactly what commands are being executed and with what arguments.

## Deep Dive
When it comes to printing debug output, Fish Shell offers some convenient features that can make your life easier. For example, you can use the `set -q` command to check if a variable exists. This can be helpful in avoiding errors in your code if a variable is undefined. You can also use the `read` command to prompt the user for input and store it in a variable.

Another useful feature is the `count` command, which can be used to count the number of elements in an array. This can come in handy when debugging code that involves arrays. Additionally, the `status` command can be used to check the exit status of the previous command, which can be helpful in error handling.
