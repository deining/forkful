## Why

If you're a developer or programmer looking to streamline your workflow and improve your productivity, then creating a new project with Fish Shell may be just what you need. Fish Shell is a user-friendly, open-source command-line shell that offers a variety of features and customization options for a seamless coding experience.

## How To

To get started with Fish Shell, you first need to install it on your system. This can be easily done by following the instructions on the official Fish Shell website (https://fishshell.com/). Once installed, you can open Fish Shell by typing `fish` in your terminal.

To create a new project, you can use the `mkdir` command to make a new directory for your project. For example, you can type `mkdir my_project` to create a folder named "my_project". Then, you can use the `cd` command to navigate into the new project directory.

Next, you can use the `touch` command to create a new file within the project directory. For example, you can type `touch index.js` to create a JavaScript file named "index.js". Then, you can use your preferred code editor to start writing your code.

```Fish Shell
mkdir my_project
cd my_project
touch index.js
```

Once you have finished writing your code, you can run it using Fish Shell's built-in interpreter. For example, if you have a Python project, you can use the `python` command to run your code. If you have a JavaScript project, you can use the `node` command. This makes it easy to test and debug your code without having to switch between multiple programs.

```Fish Shell
python main.py
```

## Deep Dive

One of the great things about using Fish Shell for your projects is the ability to customize your shell environment. You can create aliases for commonly used commands, functions to automate repetitive tasks, and even customize your prompt to show relevant information.

Additionally, Fish Shell also has a built-in package manager called "fisher" that allows you to easily install and manage extensions for your shell. These extensions can add even more features and functionality to help streamline your workflow.

Lastly, Fish Shell has a vibrant community with a wiki, forum, and IRC channel where you can find help and resources for your projects. This makes it easy to get support and learn new tips and tricks for using Fish Shell.
