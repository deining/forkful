## What & Why?
Starting a new project is the process of creating a new program or application from scratch. Programmers do this to solve a problem, build a new tool, or to learn and practice their skills.

## How to:
Coding is the key to starting a new project, and with Fish Shell, it's even easier. Here's an example of creating a new project directory and navigating into it:
```
Fish Shell  ``` 
$ mkdir my-project
$ cd my-project
``` 

## Deep Dive:
It's believed that the term "project" originated from the Latin word "proiectum," meaning "something thrown forth." In the world of programming, starting a new project is essential for creativity and innovation. While there are many different programming languages and tools available, Fish Shell is a popular choice for its simplicity and powerful capabilities.
