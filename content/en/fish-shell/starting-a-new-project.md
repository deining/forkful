## Why

Are you tired of using traditional command line shells and looking for a more user-friendly alternative? Look no further than Fish Shell! With its intuitive auto-complete and friendly syntax, Fish Shell is the perfect choice for your next project.

## How To

First, make sure you have Fish Shell installed on your system. Once installed, you can start using Fish Shell by simply opening your terminal and typing ```fish```. This will start a new Fish Shell session.

To create a new project directory, use the ```mkdir``` command followed by the desired name of your project. For example, ```mkdir my_project``` will create a new directory named "my_project" in your current location.

Next, navigate to your project directory by using the ```cd``` command. For example, ```cd my_project``` will take you to the "my_project" directory.

Now, we can start writing our code. Fish Shell uses a familiar syntax, similar to other shell languages. For example, to create a new file named "hello_world.txt", we can use the ```touch``` command: ```touch hello_world.txt```.

To add content to our file, we can use the ```echo``` command: ```echo "Hello World!" > hello_world.txt```. This will add the text "Hello World!" to the "hello_world.txt" file.

To see the content of our file, we can use the ```cat``` command: ```cat hello_world.txt```. This will output "Hello World!" on the terminal.

## Deep Dive

Fish Shell has some great features that can make starting a new project even easier. For example, Fish Shell has an auto-complete feature that suggests commands and file names as you type, making it much easier to navigate and write code.

Fish Shell also has a built-in help system that can be accessed by typing ```help``` in the terminal. This is a great resource for learning more about the different commands and options available in Fish Shell.

Additionally, Fish Shell has a powerful job control system, allowing you to run multiple commands simultaneously and easily manage them.
