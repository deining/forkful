## What & Why?

Creating a temporary file is a common task in programming. Temporary files are used to store temporary data or intermediate results during a program's execution. This data may be needed for further processing or may be discarded once the program finishes running. 

Programmers use temporary files for a variety of reasons, such as optimizing memory usage, preventing data loss in case of program interruptions, or facilitating communication between different parts of a program.

## How to:

To create a temporary file in the Fish Shell, you can use the `mktemp` command followed by the desired file name. For example, to create a temporary file named "mytempfile", you would enter:

```
Fish Shell> mktemp mytempfile
```

This will create a temporary file with a unique name in the current directory. You can then use the `echo` command to add data to the file, like this:

```
Fish Shell> echo "This is a temporary file." > mytempfile
```

To see the contents of the temporary file, you can use the `cat` command:

```
Fish Shell> cat mytempfile
This is a temporary file.
```

Once the temporary file is no longer needed, you can use the `rm` command to delete it:

```
Fish Shell> rm mytempfile
```

## Deep Dive:

The concept of temporary files dates back to the early days of computing, when computer memory and storage capacities were much lower than they are today. Temporary files were used to store data that could not fit in memory, allowing programs to run smoothly.

Creating a temporary file is not the only way to store temporary data during program execution. Some alternatives include using environment variables, pipes, or in-memory data structures. However, temporary files offer the advantage of being persistent and easily accessible, making them a popular choice among programmers.

Internally, the `mktemp` command uses the `mkstemp()` system call to create a unique temporary file. This ensures that each time the command is executed, a new temporary file with a different name is created. The `mktemp` command also creates the file with secure permissions, making it inaccessible to other users on the system.
