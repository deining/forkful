## What & Why?

Rounding a number is the process of adjusting it to the nearest whole number or to a specified number of decimal places. Programmers often round numbers to simplify figures, improve readability, or to meet specific requirements such as when dealing with currency where only two decimal places are considered.

## How to:

Rounding numbers in Fish shell can be done using the `math` command. Here are a couple of examples showing how you would round numbers to the nearest whole number and to two decimal places.

```ProgLang.FISH_SHELL
# Rounding to the nearest whole number
echo "scale=0; (20.5+0.5)/1" | bc
```
Output:
```
21
```

```ProgLang.FISH_SHELL
# Rounding to two decimal places
echo "scale=2; (20.5555)/1" | bc
```
Output:
```
20.56
```

Note that we use `bc`, a command-line calculator program, along with the `scale` to define the number of decimal places.

## Deep Dive

Rounding has been part of mathematical operations for centuries, as it's a fundamental concept in number theory. The `bc` (basic calculator) program which often is used within fish shell scripting for math operations, has existed in Unix-like systems for decades and serves as a powerful tool for precision arithmetic.

Other methods of rounding could involve different utilities or programming languages, like `awk`, which is also commonly used in shell scripting. 

As for implementation details, remember that `bc` in its simplest form truncates numbers rather than rounding them, which is why you'll often see the addition of "0.5" before division in the rounding method to ensure proper rounding as per mathematical standards.

When it comes to precision, `bc` allows you to specify the scale (number of decimal places), but keep in mind that large-scale calculations might impact performance.
