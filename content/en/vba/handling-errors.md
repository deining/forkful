## What & Why?

Handling errors in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) is about managing the unexpected. Programmers use error-handling techniques to gracefully respond to conditions that would otherwise crash an application or result in incorrect output.

## How to:

In VBA, the primary method for handling errors involves the `On Error` statement. It can be used in several ways, but two common approaches are `On Error Goto` and `On Error Resume Next`.

### Example 1: On Error Goto

This technique redirects the program flow to a specific line or label when an error occurs.

```Visual Basic for Applications
Sub ErrorHandlerExample()
    On Error GoTo ErrHandler
    Dim x As Integer
    x = 5 / 0 ' This will cause a divide by zero error

    Exit Sub
    
ErrHandler:
    MsgBox "An error occurred: " & Err.Description, vbExclamation
    Resume Next
End Sub
```

Running this subroutine will trigger a divide-by-zero error, but instead of crashing, it displays a message box with the error description and then resumes execution with the statement following the one that caused the error.

### Example 2: On Error Resume Next

This approach allows the program to continue with the next line of code after an error has occurred, useful for skipping over errors in a loop.

```Visual Basic for Applications
Sub ResumeNextExample()
    On Error Resume Next
    Dim array(5) As Integer
    Dim i As Integer

    For i = 0 To 10 ' This will exceed the array bounds
        array(i) = i
    Next i
    
    If Err.Number <> 0 Then
        MsgBox "An error occurred: " & Err.Description, vbExclamation
    End If
End Sub
```

This code attempts to assign values beyond the array's bounds but continues running quietly due to `On Error Resume Next`. It checks for an error and displays a message box if one was encountered.

## Deep Dive

Error handling in VBA has its roots in the early days of BASIC, where simple and robust handling mechanisms were necessary for stability. Over time, as the language evolved, so did its capabilities for managing errors, integrating more sophisticated methods like exception handling in other programming languages. However, VBA's error-handling mechanisms, though functional, are considered less powerful or flexible compared to structured error handling in languages like VB.NET with `Try...Catch...Finally`.

One key factor to consider with `On Error Resume Next` is that it can potentially lead to silent failures if errors are not explicitly checked for and handled. Consequently, while it's suitable for specific scenarios, overreliance on it can mask issues that would be better addressed directly. Conversely, `On Error Goto` allows for more controlled error management by routing program flow to an error handling block.

Despite these approaches, many modern programming practices favor more explicit exception handling mechanisms available in languages like Python or Java. However, within the constraints and context of VBA, understanding and using `On Error` effectively can greatly enhance the resilience and reliability of scripts and macro-driven applications.
