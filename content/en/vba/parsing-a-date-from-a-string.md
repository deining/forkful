## What & Why?
Parsing a date from a string in VBA is about extracting and converting textual data into a date format that Excel can recognize and work with. Programmers do this because dates often come in various formats and need standardizing to ensure consistency in data manipulation and analysis.

## How to:
In VBA, parsing a date from a string might seem daunting, but it's pretty straightforward with the `DateValue` and `CDate` functions. Here's how you can do it:

```Visual Basic for Applications
Sub ParseDateFromString()
    Dim dateString As String
    Dim parsedDate As Date

    ' Example 1: Using DateValue when the date format is recognized
    dateString = "10/23/2023" ' MM/DD/YYYY format
    parsedDate = DateValue(dateString)
    MsgBox "Parsed Date (DateValue): " & parsedDate

    ' Example 2: Using CDate for more flexibility
    dateString = "23-Oct-2023" ' A more complex format
    parsedDate = CDate(dateString)
    MsgBox "Parsed Date (CDate): " & parsedDate
End Sub
```
When you run this script, it'll show message boxes with the dates parsed from the provided strings, showcasing both the `DateValue` and `CDate` functions.

## Deep Dive
Parsing dates in VBA has its nuances. The `DateValue` function works well with strings that are in a recognizable date format for your locale settings. However, its capacity to parse complex or unconventional date formats is limited. That's where `CDate` shinesâ€”it's more flexible, attempting to understand and convert a wider range of date string formats.

Historically, handling dates in VBA was a bit of a challenge, especially when dealing with international date formats. The introduction and improvement of functions like `CDate` made it easier to work across different locales.

It's worth noting that while VBA does a decent job, modern programming languages and environments offer more robust and intuitive date parsing capabilities, often with extensive support for international date formats and better error handling. Tools like Python's `datetime` module or JavaScript's `Date` object provide more functionality and are worth exploring if you frequently work with dates in diverse formats. Nonetheless, understanding date parsing in VBA remains crucial for those working within VBA-centric ecosystems such as Excel macros and Access databases.
