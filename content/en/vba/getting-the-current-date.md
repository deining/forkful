## What & Why?

We're diving into how to snag the current date in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). Why? Because whether it's logging, time-stamping data entries, or setting up date-dependent conditions, knowing how to fetch the today's date is foundational in programming.

## How to:

In VBA, getting the current date (or time) is a cinch. You've got a couple of functions at your disposal: `Date` and `Now`. While `Date` gives you just that, the current date, `Now` serves up both the current date and time. Here's how you roll with them:

```Visual Basic for Applications
Sub GrabCurrentDate()
    Dim today As Date
    today = Date
    MsgBox "Today's date is: " & today
End Sub
```

This snippet sets you up with today's date, popping it up in a message box. Simple as that.

But what if you're itching for more—say, the current date AND time? VBA's got your back:

```Visual Basic for Applications
Sub GrabCurrentDateTime()
    Dim nowDateTime As Date
    nowDateTime = Now
    MsgBox "The current date and time is: " & nowDateTime
End Sub
```

Run these, and you'll see how VBA makes it painless to work with dates and times.

## Deep Dive

While VBA’s `Date` and `Now` functions provide quick access to the current date and/or time, they're part of a broader context of date and time management in programming. Historically, handling dates and times was a bit of a minefield due to differences in time zones, formats, and systems' ways of storing timestamps.

In more complex scenarios, especially when dealing with time zones or needing high precision time, VBA might not cut it—you'd likely lean on more robust languages or libraries tailored for such tasks. However, for the majority of desktop automation tasks that VBA is known for—think Excel macros and Access database scripts—`Date` and `Now` offer straightforward, efficient paths to working with temporal data, keeping your scripts nippy and tidy. 

Always consider the scope of your project. For quick-and-dirty time stamps or simple date manipulations, VBA's built-ins are perfect. But for the heavy lifting? You might want to look elsewhere.
