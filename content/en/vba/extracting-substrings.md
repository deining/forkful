## What & Why?

Extracting substrings in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) basically means slicing and dicing strings to get smaller parts out of them. Programmers do this for data parsing, manipulation, and because sometimes, you only need a piece of the data pie, not the whole thing.

## How to:

In VBA, you've got a couple of trusty functions to help you out with extracting substrings: `Left`, `Right`, and `Mid`. Let's see them in action.

```Visual Basic for Applications
' Extracting the first 5 characters
Dim exampleString As String
exampleString = "Hello World"
Dim result As String
result = Left(exampleString, 5)
' result is "Hello"

' Grabbing the last 5 characters
result = Right(exampleString, 5)
' result is "World"

' Snagging characters 4 to 7
result = Mid(exampleString, 4, 4)
' result is "lo W"
```

Pretty straightforward, right? You tell `Left` and `Right` how many characters you want from either end, and with `Mid`, you specify the start point and the number of characters you desire.

## Deep Dive

Historically, substring functions like `Left`, `Right`, and `Mid` have been around for ages and are common across many programming languages, with varying syntax. In VBA, these functions provide a foundational method for string manipulation without the need for complex logic or loops.

It's worth noting that while these functions suffice for simple and moderate substring extraction, they don't offer much flexibility for more complex patterns or conditions. In cases where patterns or specific conditions within strings are involved, regular expressions (Regex) might be a better choice. VBA supports Regex, but it requires setting a reference to "Microsoft VBScript Regular Expressions" via the Tools > References menu in the VBA editor and involves a bit more complexity.

For pure substring extraction where the start and end points are known, `Left`, `Right`, and `Mid` offer a straightforward, efficient approach. However, for dynamic, pattern-based extraction, dipping your toes into the world of Regex within VBA could unlock more powerful string manipulation capabilities.
