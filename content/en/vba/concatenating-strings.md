## What & Why?

Concatenating strings in VBA is all about sticking pieces of text together to form a single string. Programmers do it to assemble text dynamically, such as creating messages, assembling file paths, or generating queries.

## How to:

In VBA, you've got a few ways to concatenate strings. The most common method is using the `&` operator. It's straightforward: just place it between the strings you want to join. Let's dive into examples:

```Visual Basic for Applications
Dim greeting As String
Dim name As String

greeting = "Hello, "
name = "Alex!"

' Concatenating strings
Dim message As String
message = greeting & name
Debug.Print message ' Output: Hello, Alex!
```

But wait, there's more! If you're dealing with multiple pieces or want to include numbers and other data types, you can also use the `Concatenate` function or the `&` operator, like so:

```Visual Basic for Applications
Dim fullName As String
Dim firstName As String
Dim lastName As String

firstName = "Taylor"
lastName = "Smith"

' Using the & operator for more
fullName = firstName & " " & lastName
Debug.Print fullName ' Output: Taylor Smith

' Alternatively, using the built-in Join function for an array of strings
Dim words(2) As String
words(0) = "Visual"
words(1) = "Basic"
words(2) = "Rocks!"

Dim sentence As String
sentence = Join(words, " ") ' Space as separator
Debug.Print sentence ' Output: Visual Basic Rocks!
```

These snippets give you the gist of string concatenation in VBA, whether you're just sticking two words together or assembling more complex sentences.

## Deep Dive:

Concatenating strings in VBA has been pretty consistent over the years, largely relying on the trusty `&` operator. However, it's worth noting that while the `&` operator is your bread and butter for quick concatenations, other methodologies like the `Join` function or constructing strings with `Format` might be preferred for more complex scenarios or when working with arrays.

Historically, VBA developers had to be mindful of performance and readability when concatenating strings, especially in loops or when dealing with large datasets. Excessive use of `&` in these scenarios could lead to slower execution times, which is why alternatives such as using the `StringBuilder` class (available through .NET interop) have been considered for intensive string manipulation tasks.

However, for the majority of everyday tasks, the simplicity and directness of using `&` or `Concatenate` function make them a go-to. Advanced methods are available and recommended when performance becomes a key concern. It's this balance between convenience and efficiency that has kept string concatenation in VBA relatively straightforward, with developers having the flexibility to choose the best tool for their specific task.
