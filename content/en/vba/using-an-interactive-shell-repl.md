## What & Why?

An interactive shell (REPL, which stands for Read-Eval-Print Loop) is a programming environment that lets you execute Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) code line by line. Programmers use it for quick experiments, debugging, or learning because it gives immediate feedback on what the code does.

## How to:

Unfortunately, VBA doesn't come with a built-in REPL environment similar to those in Python or Ruby. However, you can mimic a basic REPL functionality using the Immediate Window in the VBA editor (VBE). This window allows you to execute VBA statements on-the-fly while your Excel, Word, or other Office applications are open.

1. **Access the Immediate Window**: Press `Alt + F11` to open the VBA editor. Then press `Ctrl + G` or go to `View > Immediate Window` to bring up the Immediate Window.

2. **Execute Simple Commands**: Type any VBA statement and press Enter to execute it. For example, let's set a variable and then print its value:

```Visual Basic for Applications
Dim myVar As Integer
myVar = 10
?myVar
```
This will output `10` in the Immediate Window.

3. **Calling Functions/Subroutines**: If you have a function or subroutine defined in your module, you can call it directly from the Immediate Window. For instance, consider the following subroutine in a module:

```Visual Basic for Applications
Sub Greet(name As String)
    MsgBox "Hello, " & name
End Sub
```

You can call this subroutine by typing `Call Greet("John")` in the Immediate Window, which will display a message box saying "Hello, John".

## Deep Dive

The Immediate Window in VBA serves as a rudimentary REPL, but it's not nearly as powerful or versatile as full-fledged REPL environments found in other programming languages. It's designed more for quick tests and debugging rather than as a primary tool for developing and experimenting with code.

Historically, VBA and other similar languages have not emphasized interactive programming environments, possibly due to their heavy integration with desktop applications and a focus on event-driven programming. However, the Immediate Window offers a sneak peek into the benefits of REPL-like interactions, especially for debugging or learning the language.

For tasks requiring a more sophisticated REPL or interactive scripting environment, languages like Python or JavaScript might be better suited, as they offer these tools out of the box. Yet, the Immediate Window is a useful feature for quick tasks, learning, and debugging within the context of VBA and shouldn't be overlooked.
