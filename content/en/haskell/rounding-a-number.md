## What & Why?

Rounding a number means reducing the decimal places to a specified level, often to the nearest whole number. Programmers do it to simplify numbers for readability, to meet certain numerical requirements, or to limit the precision due to storage or performance constraints.

## How to:

In Haskell, you can round numbers using functions from the `Prelude` module, which is imported by default. The most commonly used functions for rounding are `round`, `floor`, and `ceiling`. Here’s a quick look at how they work:

```haskell
import Prelude

main :: IO ()
main = do
  print $ round 3.5    -- 4
  print $ floor 3.7    -- 3
  print $ ceiling 3.3  -- 4
```

When executed, you'll see that `round` rounds to the nearest even number when you’re exactly between two numbers. `floor` and `ceiling` round down and up to the nearest whole number respectively.

## Deep Dive

Rounding numbers is a basic mathematical operation with deep roots in both mathematics and computer science. However, the rounding methods that we use can vary. Historically, these differences come from a need to address various use cases such as statistical analysis, financial calculations where the smallest unit is meaningful (think rounding currency), and computer graphics where performance might trump precision.

In Haskell, the rounding functions are part of the standard library, and they return an integral value. That's handy when you want a result that's compatible with other integer-based functions or data structures.

It's also worth noting that the strategies for rounding can be adjusted. `round` in Haskell uses Banker’s rounding, which is different from simply chopping off the decimal or always rounding up or down. Instead, it rounds to the nearest even number to reduce any bias that might accumulate when adding rounded numbers together.

Alternatives for more control over rounding include using libraries like `Data.Fixed` for fixed-point arithmetic, which allows specifying exactly how many decimal places to keep.

As for implementation details, the rounding functions use mathematical operations that are very efficient on modern hardware, but the exact implementation can depend on the Haskell compiler you are using (such as GHC).
