## Why

HTML is the backbone of the internet, and almost every website is based on it. As a programmer, it is crucial to understand the structure and content of HTML in order to manipulate and extract data from it. This is where the skill of parsing HTML comes in handy.

## How To

Parsing HTML using Java can be done using various libraries such as jsoup, HTML Parser, or even by writing your own custom parser. Let's take a look at a simple example of parsing HTML using jsoup library.

```
//Import jsoup library
import org.jsoup.Jsoup;
import org.jsoup.nodes.Document;
import org.jsoup.nodes.Element;

//Creating a Document object with the HTML source
Document doc = Jsoup.connect("https://www.example.com").get();

//Selecting an element by its class
Element element = doc.select(".sample-class").first();

//Extracting text from the element
String text = element.text();
System.out.println(text); //Output: This is a sample text
```

In the above code, we have imported the jsoup library, created a Document object by passing the URL of the website we want to parse, selected an element by its class, and extracted text from it. This is just a basic example, but with the help of jsoup, you can do much more complex parsing like extracting data from specific elements, handling errors, etc.

## Deep Dive

HTML is a markup language, meaning it contains tags that define the structure and content of a web page. When parsing HTML, the parser breaks down the HTML document into its individual tags and extracts data from them. This data can then be manipulated or saved for further use.

One important thing to note while parsing HTML is that websites can change their HTML structure at any time. This means that your parser might not work properly if it is designed to work with a specific website's HTML structure. Hence, it is essential to constantly monitor and adapt your parser accordingly.
