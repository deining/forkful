## Why

If you've ever wanted to extract specific data from a website or scrape information from web pages, then you'll need to know how to parse HTML. HTML is the language used to structure and present content on the web, which makes it essential for web scraping and data extraction. In this article, we'll dive into the world of HTML parsing and show you how to do it in Java.

## How To

To parse HTML in Java, you'll need to use a library or framework. One popular choice is jsoup, a Java library designed specifically for web scraping and HTML parsing. Here's an example of how to use jsoup to parse a simple HTML page and extract the title:

```Java
Document doc = Jsoup.connect("https://example.com").get();
String title = doc.title();
System.out.println(title);
// Output: Example Domain
```

The first line uses the `Jsoup.connect()` method to connect to the website and retrieve its HTML content. Then, we use the `get()` method to get the HTML document. After that, we can use the `title()` method to extract the page's title and store it in a variable. Finally, we print the title to the console using `System.out.println()`.

You can also use jsoup to retrieve specific elements from the HTML page, such as links, images, and more. Here's an example of how to extract all the links from a page:

```Java
Elements links = doc.select("a[href]");
for (Element link : links) {
    String linkHref = link.attr("href");
    System.out.println(linkHref);
}
// Output: https://example.com/about
// https://example.com/contact
// https://example.com/products
```

In this example, we use the `select()` method to retrieve all the `<a>` elements with an `href` attribute. Then, we loop through each link and use the `attr()` method to get the value of the `href` attribute.

## Deep Dive

HTML parsing can get more complex when dealing with large and dynamic websites. You may encounter different types of elements, attributes, or even custom data structures. In such cases, it's important to understand the structure of the HTML page and use more advanced techniques to extract the desired data.

Jsoup provides many useful methods to navigate and manipulate HTML. You can use CSS selectors, regular expressions, or even a combination of both to select elements from the HTML document. Additionally, you can also use browser developer tools to inspect the HTML structure of a page and test your parsing code.

Another useful technique for HTML parsing is using XPath. XPath is a query language used to navigate through XML data, and HTML is considered a type of XML. Jsoup allows you to use XPath expressions to select specific elements from an HTML page. This can be especially helpful when dealing with complex and deeply nested HTML structures.
