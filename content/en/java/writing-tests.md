## Why

Writing tests for your Java code may seem like an tedious and unnecessary task, but it is actually a crucial aspect of software development. By writing tests, you can catch potential bugs and errors before they reach your production environment, saving time and resources in the long run.

## How To

Writing tests in Java is made easy with the use of the JUnit testing framework. Let's start with a simple example where we want to test a method that calculates the area of a rectangle.

```
Java
@Test
public void testRectangleArea(){
    // Create an instance of Rectangle class
    Rectangle rectangle = new Rectangle(5, 10);
    // Create an instance of RectangleTest class
    RectangleTest test = new RectangleTest();
    // Use assert equals to compare the expected and actual results
    assertEquals(50, test.getArea(rectangle));
}
```

In the above code, we have annotated our test method with `@Test` from the JUnit framework. Then, we create an instance of the class we want to test and an instance of our test class. Finally, we use the `assertEquals` method to compare the expected and actual results.

Running this test would yield a successful output, confirming that our method correctly calculates the area of a rectangle.

```
Java
Test successful!
```

## Deep Dive

When writing tests, it is important to cover edge cases and handle exceptions properly. In our previous example, we only tested the method with positive values for length and width. What if we passed in negative values?

```
Java
@Test
public void testNegativeRectangle(){
    Rectangle rectangle = new Rectangle(-5, -10);
    RectangleTest test = new RectangleTest();
    assertEquals(50, test.getArea(rectangle));
}
```

This test would fail, as expected. We can then refine our test methods to handle negative values and throw exceptions, ensuring that our code can handle different scenarios and prevent potential bugs.
