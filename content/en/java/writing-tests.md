## Why

Writing tests in Java can seem like an extra step in the development process, but it can greatly benefit your code in the long run. By writing tests, you can catch bugs and identify errors early on, making debugging and troubleshooting much easier.

## How To

To write tests in Java, you will need a testing framework such as JUnit. This framework provides an easy and structured way to write and run tests.

Let's say we have a simple function that adds two numbers and returns the result. We can write a test for this function using JUnit, like this:

```Java
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;

public class CalculatorTest {
    
    // Test adding two positive numbers
    @Test
    public void testAddition() {
        Calculator calc = new Calculator();
        int result = calc.add(5, 10);
        
        // Assert that the result is equal to expected value
        assertEquals(15, result);
    }
    
    // Test adding a negative and a positive number
    @Test
    public void testNegativeNumber() {
        Calculator calc = new Calculator();
        int result = calc.add(-10, 5);
        
        // Assert that the result is equal to expected value
        assertEquals(-5, result);
    }
}
```

The `testAddition()` and `testNegativeNumber()` methods are annotated with `@Test` to indicate that they are test cases. Within these methods, we create an instance of the `Calculator` class and use the `assertEquals()` method to compare the expected result with the actual result returned by the `add()` function.

When we run this test class, we will see that both tests pass, meaning our `add()` function is working as expected. This is just a simple example, but in a larger and more complex project, writing tests can save a lot of time and effort when it comes to troubleshooting.

## Deep Dive

Writing tests not only helps to identify bugs and errors, but it also promotes better coding practices. By writing tests, you are essentially breaking down your code into smaller, testable components. This can help you to write more modular and reusable code, which is essential for building maintainable and scalable applications.

It's important to note that writing tests does not guarantee a bug-free code. However, it greatly reduces the chances of major issues and can save you from headaches down the road. Additionally, as your codebase grows, having a comprehensive suite of tests can give you the confidence to make changes and additions without breaking existing functionality.
