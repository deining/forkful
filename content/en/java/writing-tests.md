## What & Why?
Writing tests is the process of creating code that validates the functionality of your program. This involves writing small snippets of code that test specific pieces of your program's functionality. Programmers write tests to ensure that their code is working as expected and to catch any potential bugs before they become bigger issues.

## How to:
Writing tests in Java is a relatively simple process. First, you need to create a new class that will contain your tests. Within this class, you can use the JUnit framework to create test methods. These methods will use a special annotation (@Test) that marks them as tests. Within the test method, you can use the JUnit assertion methods to check if your code is producing the expected output.

```Java
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;

public class CalculatorTest {

    @Test
    public void testAddition() {
        // Given
        int x = 5;
        int y = 10;

        // When
        int result = Calculator.add(x, y);

        // Then
        assertEquals(15, result);
    }
}
```

The above example shows a test method for a simple calculator program. We use the JUnit assertion method `assertEquals()` to check if our `add()` method is correctly adding two numbers.

## Deep Dive:
The practice of writing tests in software development has been around for a long time and has evolved over the years. In the past, developers used manual testing methods, which were time-consuming and prone to human error. With the advent of automated testing frameworks like JUnit, writing tests has become more efficient and reliable.

There are also alternative testing frameworks available for Java, such as TestNG and Mockito. These frameworks provide different features and might be a better fit for different project requirements.

When writing tests, it's essential to have a good understanding of the code you're testing and the edge cases that need to be covered. It's also crucial to regularly run tests and update them as your code changes.
