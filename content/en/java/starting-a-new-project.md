## What & Why?
Starting a new project in programming refers to creating a new software or application from scratch. Programmers do this in order to meet a specific need or solve a problem. It allows them to have full control over the project and tailor it to their unique requirements.

## How to:
Coding in Java to start a new project is a simple process. First, import the necessary packages and create a main method. Then, declare and initialize any variables needed for the project. Finally, use the System.out.println() method to print out the desired output. Here is an example code:

```Java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class NewProject {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
      int num1, num2, sum;
      
      System.out.print("Enter first number: ");
      num1 = input.nextInt();
      
      System.out.print("Enter second number: ");
      num2 = input.nextInt();
      
      sum = num1 + num2;
      System.out.println("Sum = " + sum);
   }
}
```

Output:
Enter first number: 5 <br>
Enter second number: 3 <br>
Sum = 8

## Deep Dive:
Creating a new project in Java is a widely-used practice due to its flexibility and scalability. It allows for efficient coding and easy maintenance, making it a preferred language for large projects. Additionally, Java is a cross-platform language, meaning the code can run on any operating system.

There are alternative languages for starting a new project, such as Python or C++, but Java's object-oriented programming approach makes it easier to understand and modify code. This is especially useful for collaborative projects.

The implementation of starting a new project in Java involves creating a package to organize the code and then defining classes within that package. From there, objects and methods can be created to perform various tasks. It's important to continuously test and debug the code during the development process.
