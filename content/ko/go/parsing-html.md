# HTML Parsing in Go: What and Why?

HTML parsing is the process of interpreting and analyzing HTML code to extract meaningful information from a web page. Programmers use this technique to scrape data, analyze web content, and build web applications.

# How to:

```Go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "net/http"

    "github.com/PuerkitoBio/goquery"
)

func main() {
    // Get the HTML body of a webpage
    res, err := http.Get("https://www.example.com")
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error:", err)
    }
    defer res.Body.Close()

    // Load the HTML document into goquery
    doc, err := goquery.NewDocumentFromReader(res.Body)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error:", err)
    }

    // Find all <a> tags and print the href attribute
    doc.Find("a").Each(func(i int, s *goquery.Selection) {
        fmt.Println(s.Attr("href"))
    })
}
```

Output:

```
https://www.example.com
```

# Deep Dive

HTML parsing has been an essential tool for web developers since the early days of the internet. Before the advent of modern web development frameworks, parsing HTML was the only way to extract data from web pages.

Although there are alternative methods for scraping data, such as using APIs, HTML parsing is still relevant due to its versatility and the sheer amount of data that can be extracted from a single web page.

Go provides various packages and libraries such as goquery, which make parsing HTML in Go a straightforward task. These libraries handle the complexity of parsing HTML and allow developers to focus on building their applications.
