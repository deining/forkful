## How to: (如何操作：)
Ruby makes playing with dates quite friendly. Here's how you can do it:

```Ruby
require 'date'

today = Date.today
# 将日期往未来增加5天
future_date = today + 5
# 将日期往过去减少10天
past_date = today - 10

puts "Today is: #{today}"
puts "Future Date: #{future_date}"
puts "Past Date: #{past_date}"
```

Sample output (示例输出):
```
Today is: 2023-04-12
Future Date: 2023-04-17
Past Date: 2023-04-02
```

## Deep Dive (深入探索):
Before Ruby's `Date` class, programmers had to calculate dates manually which was error-prone. Ruby's standard library and gems like 'activesupport' provide robust methods for date manipulation, making tasks simpler and more readable.

Alternative ways to calculate date include Time and ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone for more complex time zone handling. Ruby's `Date` performs well for date-specific manipulations.

细节：Ruby在内部使用格里高利历，对于处理不同文化和历史日期也有良好支持。还可以引入'time_difference'宝石来处理更复杂的日期和时间计算任务。
